# Cross Project Council (CPC) Charter

## Section 1. Guiding Principle.

The OpenJS Foundation will operate transparently, openly,
collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status
must not merely be open, but also easily visible to outsiders.

## Section 2. Evolution of OpenJS Foundation Governance.

Most large, complex open source communities have both a business and a
technical governance model. OpenJS Foundation’s technical leadership
is the Cross Project Council (“CPC”). OpenJS Foundation’s business
leadership is the Board of Directors (the “Board”).

This Cross Project Council Charter reflects a carefully
constructed, balanced role for the CPC and the Board in the governance of
OpenJS Foundation. The charter amendment process is for the
OpenJS Foundation to propose changes using simple majority of the
full OpenJS Foundation, the proposed changes being subject to review
and approval by the Board. The Board may additionally make amendments to
the OpenJS Foundation charter at any time, though the Board will not interfere
with day-to-day discussions, votes or meetings
of the CPC.

The above notwithstanding, the CPC may make trivial changes to the charter
without requiring board approval, including spelling and punctuation fixes,
so long as they do not change the meaning of the text.

## Section 3. Board’s Role in Setting OpenJS Foundation’s Strategic Direction.

The Board will set the overall CPC Policy. The policy will describe the
overarching scope of the OpenJS Foundation initiative, OpenJS Foundation
Foundation’s technical vision and direction and project release
expectations in the form of expected cadence and intent. The Board will
use the CPC as a delegate body for governing technical implementation,
individual project scope and direction while they remain within the scope
and direction of the policies as described in the CPC Policy document and
approved by the Board.

The Board sets the overall CPC policy through [Foundation mission and vision statements][] as well as within the [Foundation bylaws][]. The policy describes
the overarching scope of the OpenJS Foundation initiatives , technical vision,
and direction. The Board uses the CPC as a delegate body for governing
high-level technical policy and procedures while remaining within the scope and
direction of the policies set by the Board.


## Section 4. Establishment of the CPC.

The CPC is an inclusive group with three types of participants:

* Observers
* Regular members
* Voting members


### Observers

Observers are free to attend meetings and participate in the work of the
CPC as well as the consensus seeking process.

### Regular members

Regular members have made a commitment to be involved in an ongoing manner
and take on roles and responsibilities as outlined below.
Regular member is implied when membership type is not
specified. Anyone who has been active in the work of the OpenJS Foundation, 
one of its member projects or other related activity as described in the CPC Governance 
may request to become a regular member by opening a PR to add themselves to the list of
regular members. Regular members remain for as long as they are active
within the work of the CPC. Regular members who have not been active
in GitHub, participated in meetings, or other work of the CPC for 3 months may be
removed from the list of Regular members. In addition, a Regular CPC member
can be removed by voluntary resignation, or by a standard CPC motion.

### Voting members

Voting members are selected as follows:

* Each Impact project may nominate up to two members through a process
of their choosing. Once nominated the member must be ratified by the
CPC Voting members before becoming a Voting member.

* up to two Voting members may be nominated by the non Impact projects based
on a process set by the CPC.

* up to two Voting members may be nominated by the Regular members. Once
nominated these members must be ratified by the CPC Voting members
before becoming a Voting member.

Voting members are expected to make a time commitment which
allows them to be responsive to CPC business, participate regularly
in meetings and to participate in all voting matters (either by
voting or specifically abstaining).  They are
also expected to help to enable work of the regular CPC
members by providing leadership, help with interactions with the
board and Foundation staff and to generally help keep things moving.

Voting members serve for a term of 1 year and must be re-nominated
and ratified by the Voting CPC members each year. In addition, a Voting CPC member
can be removed by voluntary resignation, by a standard CPC motion,
or in accordance to the participation rules described for Regular
members.

Changes to CPC membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be suggested
as any other agenda item.

No more than one-fourth of the Voting CPC members may be affiliated with the
same employer. Removal or resignation of a Voting CPC member, or a change of
employment by a Voting CPC member could cause more than
one-fourth of the Voting CPC membership to be affiliated with the same employer.
Such a situation must be immediately remedied by the resignation or
removal of one or more voting CPC members.

If a voting CPC member steps down before the end of their one year term or they
are removed from the CPC by a CPC motion they may be replaced using the same
process by which they were elected. In this case the member will serve out the
remainder of the term and must be re-confirmed at the end of the original one
year term as if they had served for the full year.

The public portion of the CPC discussions and meetings will be open to all
observers and members.

The CPC shall meet regularly using tools that enable participation by the
community. The meeting shall be directed by the CPC Chairperson.
Responsibility for directing individual meetings may be
delegated by the CPC Chairperson to any other CPC member. The CPC chairperson
shall be one of the Voting members, and will be selected by the CPC members
through consensus or if necessary a vote as described in the section titled "Voting".
Minutes or an appropriate recording shall be taken and made available to
the community through accessible public postings.

Voting members have the roles and responsibilities as outlined below.

## Section 6. Non-Responsibilities of the CPC

OpenJS Foundation Projects are self-governing entities. All policies and procedures for interacting with, contributing to and making decisions within a Project are defined, implemented, and documented by that Project’s Governing Body and community during the mentorship process. Specific technical decisions within a Project will be the responsibility of the Project and establishment and implementation of the decision making process will be done within the guidelines as defined by CPC charter. Those Project decisions and responsibilities include but are not limited to:

* Setting release dates.
* Release quality standards.
* Technical direction.
* Project governance and process.
* GitHub repository hosting.
* Conduct guidelines.
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators.
* Development process and any coding standards.
* Mediating technical conflicts between Collaborators.


Not withstanding the above, the Projects and the entire technical community will follow any processes
as may be specified by the Board relating to the intake and license compliance review of contributions,
including the OpenJS Foundation IP Policy.

## Section 7. Elections

Leadership roles in OpenJS Foundation will be peer elected
representatives of the community.

For election of persons (such as the CPC Chairperson), a multiple-candidate
method should be used, such as:

* [Condorcet][] or
* [Single Transferable Vote][]

Multiple-candidate methods may be reduced to simple election by plurality
when there are only two candidates for one position to be filled. No
election is required if there is only one candidate and no objections to
the candidates election. Elections shall be done within the Projects by
the Collaborators active in the Project.


The CPC will elect from amongst CPC members a CPC Chairperson to
work on building an agenda for CPC meetings and a CPC Director to represent
the CPC to the Board for a term of one year according to the OpenJS Foundation’s
By-laws. The Chair and Director may be (but are not required to be)
the same person. The CPC shall hold annual elections to select a CPC
Chairperson and Director; there are no limits on the number of terms a
CPC Chairperson or Director may serve.

## Section 8. Board Representation

There are 3 Board seats earmarked for representation from the
OpenJS Foundation, the Foundation's projects, and related communities.

### The Primary CPC Director (as defined in §4.3(d) in the [OpenJS Foundation bylaws][])

The first of these board seats is filled as outlined in Section 7 on [Elections][] and is always in place.

**Primary CPC Director eligibility:** The Primary CPC Director must be a current CPC Member

**Primary CPC Director voting:** CPC Voting Members will vote on candidates

### The Secondary CPC Director (as defined in §4.3(e) in the [OpenJS Foundation bylaws][])

The second board seat will be filled based on processes defined
by the CPC and approved by the Voting CPC members and then the Board. The
CPC members will review and either re-confirm or update the
processes once per year.

**Secondary Director eligibility:** The Second CPC Director must be an [Active OpenJS Collaborator][] at the time of their selection, as defined in the CPC's Governance document.

**Secondary Director voting:** CPC Voting Members will vote on candidates

As described in the [Elections][] section a multiple candidate method
will be be used for the voting for the first and second board members.

### The Tertiary CPC Director (as defined in §4.3(f) in the [OpenJS Foundation bylaws][])

The third board seat is earmarked to represent the Individual membership
program. 3 Platinum board members as well as 2000 members registered in the
Individual membership program are required for it to activate.
Candidates for the Individual Membership Director are to be nominated by voting
members of the top-level committees of all projects and the voting CPC members.
Active members of the Individual Membership program would then vote on the
candidate of their choosing via an election system set by the CPC.

## Section 9. Decision Making

For internal Project decisions, Collaborators shall operate under Lazy
Consensus. The CPC follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. When
an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does
anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a CPC member can call for either a
closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting. Votes shall
follow the procedure described in the [Voting][] section of this charter.

## Section 10. Voting

The CPC follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. When an agenda
item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does anyone
object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a CPC member can call for
either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting.
The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the CPC or else the
discussion will continue.

For all votes, a simple majority of all Voting CPC members for, or against, the issue
wins. A Voting CPC member may choose to participate in any vote through abstention.

Note that, in addition to requiring a simple majority vote of the CPC Voting
CPC members, all changes to this charter are also subject to approval
from the OpenJS Foundation board.

## Section 11. Definitions

**Project**: a technical collaboration effort that is organized through the
project mentorship process and approved by the CPC.

**Contributors**: contribute code or other artifacts, but do not have the right
to commit to the code base. Contributors work with the Project's Collaborators
to have code committed to the code base. A Contributor may be promoted to a
Collaborator by the Project's Governing Body. Contributors should rarely be
encumbered by the CPC or Board.

**Collaborator**: a Contributor within a Project that has made significant and
valuable contributions and has been given commit-access to that Project
repository.

**Governing Body**: a  group of Collaborators within a Project elected to represent the Project
in an official decision making role as defined in the Project's governance
