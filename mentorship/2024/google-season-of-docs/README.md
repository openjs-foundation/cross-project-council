# OpenJS Foundation / Google Season of Docs 2024

The [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org) is applying for the [2024 Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs).

OpenJS hosts 35 critical JavaScript projects including Node.js, Electron, jQuery, webpack, Appium and Jest. 
Our mission is to support the healthy growth of JavaScript and web technologies by providing a neutral organization to host and sustain projects, as well as collaboratively fund activities that benefit the ecosystem as a whole.

We are looking for a few skilled technical writers who can help with a number of our projects. We have a large, welcoming community and would like to help grow new participants.

If you have any questions, please reach out on the [OpenJS Foundation Slack](https://slack.openjsf.org).

Here is a list of our proposals, as well as some resources to help you learn about the OpenJS Foundation.

## Projects

### Project Idea: Node.js Undici Documentation Improvement

#### Problem
Node.js Undici is a high-performance HTTP/1.1 client with connection pooling, KeepAlive, and more, providing a low-level HTTP client API. However, its documentation lacks completeness, clarity, and examples, which makes it challenging for developers to understand and utilize the full potential of Undici effectively.

#### How would we measure success?
Success can be measured by:
- Improved documentation completeness, covering all aspects of Undici's functionality.
- Enhanced clarity, ensuring that developers can easily understand the concepts and usage of Undici.
- Increased usage and adoption of Undici due to improved documentation quality.
- Positive feedback and reduced queries related to Undici usage on community forums and GitHub issues.

#### What skills would a technical writer need to work on this project?
- Proficiency in understanding technical concepts related to HTTP/1.1 clients, connection pooling, KeepAlive, and related networking topics.
- Ability to translate complex technical information into clear and concise documentation suitable for developers of varying skill levels.
- Experience writing code examples and tutorials for Node.js/JavaScript.
- Familiarity with Markdown for documentation formatting.
- Strong communication skills to collaborate with developers, gather feedback, and iterate on documentation improvements.

#### Expected outcomes:

* **Must Have**
  - Comprehensive documentation covering Undici's features, including detailed explanations and usage examples.
  - Clear and concise API reference documentation.
  - Tutorials and guides for common Undici usage scenarios.
  - Improved organization and navigation within the documentation to enhance usability.

* **Nice To Have**
  - Contributions to Undici's official website for seamless integration of the updated documentation.
  - Interactive examples or demos showcasing Undici's capabilities.
  - Better/Newer website (e.g. Docusaurus or Next.js based) 

#### Volunteers / Mentors
- Lead Mentor: [Matteo Collina](https://github.com/mcollina)
- Co-Mentor: 

#### Contact info
