# OpenJS Foundation / Google Season of Docs 2024

The [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org) is applying for the [2024 Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs).

OpenJS hosts 35 critical JavaScript projects including Node.js, Electron, jQuery, webpack, Appium and Jest. 
Our mission is to support the healthy growth of JavaScript and web technologies by providing a neutral organization to host and sustain projects, as well as collaboratively fund activities that benefit the ecosystem as a whole.

We are looking for a few skilled technical writers who can help with a number of our projects. We have a large, welcoming community and would like to help grow new participants.

If you have any questions, please reach out on the [OpenJS Foundation Slack](https://slack.openjsf.org).

Here is a list of our proposals, as well as some resources to help you learn about the OpenJS Foundation.

### Project Idea: Node.js Undici Documentation Improvement

#### Problem
Node.js Undici is a high-performance HTTP/1.1 client with connection pooling, KeepAlive, and more, providing a low-level HTTP client API. However, its documentation lacks completeness, clarity, and examples, which makes it challenging for developers to understand and utilize the full potential of Undici effectively.

#### How would we measure success?
Success can be measured by:
- Improved documentation completeness, covering all aspects of Undici's functionality.
- Enhanced clarity, ensuring that developers can easily understand the concepts and usage of Undici.
- Increased usage and adoption of Undici due to improved documentation quality.
- Positive feedback and reduced queries related to Undici usage on community forums and GitHub issues.

#### What skills would a technical writer need to work on this project?
- Proficiency in understanding technical concepts related to HTTP/1.1 clients, connection pooling, KeepAlive, and related networking topics.
- Ability to translate complex technical information into clear and concise documentation suitable for developers of varying skill levels.
- Experience writing code examples and tutorials for Node.js/JavaScript.
- Familiarity with Markdown for documentation formatting.
- Strong communication skills to collaborate with developers, gather feedback, and iterate on documentation improvements.

#### Expected outcomes:

* **Must Have**
  - Comprehensive documentation covering Undici's features, including detailed explanations and usage examples.
  - Clear and concise API reference documentation.
  - Tutorials and guides for common Undici usage scenarios.
  - Improved organization and navigation within the documentation to enhance usability.

* **Nice To Have**
  - Contributions to Undici's official website for seamless integration of the updated documentation.
  - Interactive examples or demos showcasing Undici's capabilities.
  - Better/Newer website (e.g. Docusaurus or Next.js based) 

#### Volunteers / Mentors
- Lead Mentor: [Matteo Collina](https://github.com/mcollina)
- Co-Mentor: [Ethan Arrowood](https://github.com/ethan-arrowood)

#### Contact info
For inquiries or to express interest in contributing, please reach out to hello AT matteocollina.com. You can also join the Node.js Undici community on GitHub or the OpenJS Slack for discussions and support.

### Project Idea: Node.js Learn -- Creating World-class Learning material for Node.js

#### Problem

The Node.js runtime is the world's most popular and widely adopted JavaScript runtime.
Node.js enables JavaScript Developers to create the next big thing. Node.js is a fundmanetal cornterstone of the Web.

Yet, as popular as Node.js might be, Node.js as a project needs fundamental learning material that allows people to kickstart and dive deep
into the powerhouse of Node.js. Hundreds of content creators support the Node.js community with courses and learning material.
Still, the Node.js project itself lacks fundamental learning material that allows newcomers and existing users of
Node.js to get quickly started with the basics to the next big thing that Node.js provides.

This project aims to update the existing Learn material available on the Node.js website and create new learning material
Some of the expected tasks of this project include:

- Reorganising and re-categorising the existing content
- Rephrasing and improving existing content
- Updating existing Learn outdated material
- Introducing new learning material that is relevant to the user base of Node.js

During this mentorship, the mentee can expect to be guided through the basics and fundamentals of Node.js to the gritty nitty
and the shiny new features of Node.js.

#### How would we measure success?

The success of this project is measured on at least 3 pillars for Node.js's Learn material.

- That we successfully audited the existing learning material/content
  - Not all learn pages might require extensive updates, so the success criteria are personal and depend on outcomes
    throughout the rundown of this mentorship.
- That new learning material was created based on the project's needs. It is up to the mentee to come up with new ideas
  and it is expected that the mentor will provide feedback and guidance regarding what needs to be done.
- That both the mentor and the mentee are happy with the resulting outcome of this mentorship.

Since these requirements are dynamic, the project's actual success indicator is determined by both parties
agreement (mentor and mentee) that all the required work was accomplished.

For the mentorship itself and the resulting outcomes, we can expect that the success of the project is measured by:

- Improved documentation completeness, covering essential aspects of Node.js.
- Enhanced clarity, ensuring that developers can easily understand the concepts and usage of Node.js.
- Positive feedback and reduced queries related to Node.js usage on community forums and GitHub issues.

#### What skills would a technical writer need to work on this project?

#### Expected outcomes:

* **Must Have**
  - Updated Learning material covering Node.js features, including detailed explanations and usage examples.
  - Improved organization and navigation within the Learning material to enhance usability.

* **Nice To Have**
  - Better SEO and structure for the Learn material
  - Interactive examples or demos showcasing Node.js capabilities

#### Volunteers / Mentors

- Lead Mentor: [Claudio Wunder](https://github.com/ovflowd)
- Co-mentors might include Node.js Core collaborators and other maintainers/collaborators of the Node.js website.

#### Contact info

Inquiries should, in general, be made through [OpenJS's Slack](https://openjsf.org/collaboration) on the #nodejs-website channel
or through direct contact with the mentors through OpenJS's Slack or an e-mail to `cwunder@gnome.org`
