# Google Season Of Docs 2024 Proposal

The following proposal is intended to be submitted to the 2024 Google Season of Docs program. It follows Google's suggested [template](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/org-proposal-template).

## Proposal Title

Node.js Learn, Creating World-class Learning material for Node.js - The OpenJS Foundation

## About Your Organization

### About The OpenJS Foundation

The OpenJS Foundation is the home of a wide range of JavaScript projects including Appium, Electron, jQuery, Node.js, webpack, and many more. In 2019, the Node.js Foundation and JS Foundation merged to form the OpenJS Foundation. The merger was the result of extensive reflection and collaboration by both communities and their governing bodies. It reflected a shared desire to simplify and streamline the process for hosting, sustaining and providing financial support to important projects in the JavaScript ecosystem.

### About Node.js
Node.js is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that lets developers create servers, web apps, command line tools and scripts. In 2023, Node.js had over 2 billion downloads.

## About The Project

### The Project's Problem

The Node.js runtime is the world's most popular and widely adopted JavaScript runtime. Node.js enables JavaScript Developers to create the next big thing. Node.js is a fundmanetal cornterstone of the Web.

Yet, as popular as Node.js might be, Node.js as a project needs fundamental learning material that allows people to kickstart and dive deep into the powerhouse of Node.js. Hundreds of content creators support the Node.js community with courses and learning material. Still, the Node.js project itself lacks fundamental learning material that allows newcomers and existing users of Node.js to get quickly started with the basics to the next big thing that Node.js provides.

### The Project's Scope

This project aims to update the existing Learn material available on the Node.js website and create new learning material.

Some of the expected tasks of this project include:

* Reorganising and re-categorising the existing content
* Rephrasing and improving existing content
* Updating existing Learn outdated material
* Introducing new learning material that is relevant to the user base of Node.js

During this mentorship, the technical writer can expect to be guided through the basics and fundamentals of Node.js to the gritty nitty and the shiny new features of Node.js.

We estimate that this project may take the whole duration of the Google Season of Docs program to complete, depending on the efficiency and progression of the hired technical writer.

Due to the complexity of the Learn material of the Node.js project, we expect that the technical writer will need to work closely with the Node.js project's maintainers and contributors to ensure that the learning material is up-to-date and relevant to the Node.js community.

We expect that the duration of this project to last at least the minimum of 4 months, with the possibility of extending the project if the technical writer and mentor agree on the extension. This is also based on the capacity and time availability of numerous Node.js collaborators, maintainers, and contributors. Note that the maximum duration is of 6 months as per GSoD guidelines.

Due to the shared ownership and fragmented knowledgebase of the Node.js project, this framework allows the technical writer to work with multiple contributors and maintainers of the Node.js project to ensure that the learning material is up-to-date and relevant to the Node.js community. This is expected due to the framework and the nature of the Node.js project.

We've already identified a few technical writers that have reached out to the Node.js project and we are determining that project bonding is required and getting these individuals acclimated to the Node.js community. We reserve the right of choosing the technical writer that best fits the Node.js project's needs based on Google Season of Docs guidelines and criterias.

Before a technical writer is hired, a concrete work plan will be established and bi-weekly reports (Google Docs) will be required to ensure that the project is on track and that the technical writer is getting the necessary support and guidance from the mentor. Mentor <> Technical Writer communication is expected to happen casually and frequently through OpenJS's Slack channels, Google Docs and GitHub.

### Measuring Success

The success of this project is measured on at least 3 pillars for Node.js's Learn material.

- That we successfully audited the existing learning material/content
  - Not all learn pages might require extensive updates, so the success criteria are personal and depend on outcomes throughout the rundown of this mentorship.
- That new learning material was created based on the project's needs. It is up to the technical writer to come up with new ideas and it is expected that the mentor will provide feedback and guidance regarding what needs to be done.
- That both the mentor and the technical writer are happy with the resulting outcome of this mentorship.

Since these requirements are dynamic, the project's actual success indicator is determined by both parties
agreement (mentor and technical writer) that all the required work was accomplished.

For the mentorship itself and the resulting outcomes, we can expect that the success of the project is measured by:

- Improved documentation completeness, covering essential aspects of Node.js.
- Enhanced clarity, ensuring that developers can easily understand the concepts and usage of Node.js.
- Positive feedback and reduced queries related to Node.js usage on community forums and GitHub issues.

### Timeline

The project timeline, as per the Google Season of Docs guidelines, including only action items relevant during the Google Season of Docs program, not including items before or after the offiical start of the program.

Note that the timelines below are rough estimates with the caveat that a proper work plan will be established before the start of the program.

| Dates | Action Items |
|---|---|
| May | Community bonding and discovery phase |
| June - July | Beginning of audit of existing learn material and their content |
| July - October | Continuous audit of existing learn material and iteration-based rewriting and additions of new learning material |
| November | Clean up and wrapping up of the learn material and completion of the project |

- Community bonding and discovery phase
  - The technical writer is expected to get acquainted with the Node.js project and its community and the numerous teams that work on different aspects of the Node.js project and the core (APIs) of Node.js;
  - It is expected that the technical writer gets familiar with the Website codebase (on a surface level as no programming is required or expected), with the numerous features and functionalities that Node.js provides and that they properly make notes and bond with the respective teams/maintainers of the Node.js project.
    - This is a continuous item that spills over to the next phases of the project.
- Beginning of audit of existing learn material and their content
  - The technical writer is expected to audit the existing learn material and their content and make notes of what needs to be updated, rephrased, or rewritten.
  - During this phase they must reach out to existing contributors to verify the relevance of the current material, how outdated it is and what on their opinion needs to be updated.
  - The technical writer has the liberty to make suggestions on what needs to be updated and what new learning material needs to be created.
  - During this phase the technical writer might already start writing notes of how the current learn material should be reorganised, what is outdated and what new learning material needs to be created. (aka the auditing phase)
    - These are considered the deliverables of this phase, as documenting the current state of the learn material is crucial for the next phase.
- Continuous audit of existing learn material and iteration-based rewriting and additions of new learning material
  - The technical writer is expected to start writing new content, updating/merging/rephrasing/cleaning up existing content and keep auditing the existing learn material.
  - This is a multi-phase process that will be iterated upon until the end of the project.
  - The deliverables of this phase are the updated learn material and the new learning material that was created.
- Clean up and wrapping up of the learn material and completion of the project
  - This phase contains any extra or final changes that need to be made to the learn material.
  - The technical writer is expected to wrap up the learn material and ensure that all the necessary changes have been made.

During this program's duration we expect that real changes to the Node.js website are made progressively, instead of one big change at the end of the program. This is to ensure that the Node.js project's maintainers and contributors can review the changes and provide feedback on the changes that were made.

Every phase expects to have a bi-weekly report that will be shared with the mentor and the Node.js project's maintainers and contributors. This is to ensure that the project is on track and that the technical writer is getting the necessary support and guidance from the mentor.

### Project Budget

| Budget Item | Amount | Notes/Justifications |
|---|---|---|
| Technical writer's (audit, update, publish of content) | 8000.00 USD | We understand that this technical work will be complex and require a lot of iteration, communication and technical understanding of the Node.js project. Hence we believe the writer should be paid accordingly |
| Node.js mentors | 2x 500.00 USD | We expect to have up to 2 main mentors that are leading the communication and the program management of this project |
