# OpenJS Foundation / Google Season of Docs 2020

The [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org) is applying for the [2020 Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs).

The [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org) is made up of 32 open source JavaScript projects including Appium, Dojo, jQuery, Node.js, and webpack. We are currently incubating projects as well, including AMP, Electron, nvm, and fastify.

Our mission is to support the healthy growth of JavaScript and web technologies by providing a neutral organization to host and sustain projects, as well as collaboratively fund activities that benefit the ecosystem as a whole.

We are looking for a few skilled technical writers who can help with a number of our projects.  We have a large, welcoming community and would like to help grow new participants.

If you have any questions, please reach out on the [OpenJS Foundation Slack](https://slack.openjsf.org).

Here is a list of our proposals, as well as some resources to help you learn about the OpenJS Foundation.

### Proposal 1. Node.js (medium)

**Proposal Title**: ES Modules Documentation

**Description**: The Node.js ECMAScript modules support is gradually working its way towards stability, with the major features of the implementation now finally largely set. The documentation has evolved to document each new feature as it has been added that would now benefit from some consolidation of the information in a way that is easily accessible to users. We are looking to guide a technical writer in refining the existing documentation while also creating high-level guides ensuring users are able to easily achieve their goals with modules in Node.js.

**Expected outcomes**: Ensure the Node.js documentation on ES modules is accessible to all users, from a new user writing their first application and publishing their first package to a seasoned OS developer migrating from CommonJS to ES modules and maintaining a package for many JS environments.

**Skills required/preferred**: JavaScript, Node.js, npm package experience. Experience publishing packages or using JS build tools is a plus.

**Mentors**: Guy Bedford, Geoffrey Booth

### Proposal 2. Fastify (medium)

**Proposal Title**

Overhaul Fastify Docs

**Description**

Fastify docs grew organically and they were never planned from a user
perspective.
The current documentation is comprehensive about all the features
Fastify has,
but it does not provide the right information at the right time.
Moreover, different pages use different pronouns!

Taking example from other amazing Open Source frameworks docs,
Fastify needs to establish a Style Guideline (see
[Gatsby's](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/gatsby-style-guide/),
and then proceed with creating a new structure for the our docs that is
focused on the users.

**Expected outcomes:**

1. Style guideline for Fastify
2. Glossary of terms
3. Overhauled doc structure
4. Reword the docs to follow the syle guide

Bonus points:

Add a few official tutorials and walkthrough on our website.


**Skills required/preferred:**

JavaScript, Node.js, git, github, markdown, HTTP, npm

**Mentor:**

Matteo Collina, Tomas Della Vedova
