# Cross Project Council Community Fund

## About The Community Fund

The OpenJS Foundationâ€™s community fund supports travel and attendance at events and activities directly related to OpenJS projects, technologies, or goals. We support travel for individuals who are:

* Collaborators
* Standards body participants
* At least 18 years old and recognized as adults in both the country of departure and the destination country, based on local laws (ref: [Age of Majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority))

> [!Note]
> If you're _speaking_ at an event, you should apply through the [OpenJS Foundation's Speakers Bureau](https://openjsf.org/events#:~:text=Speakers%20Bureau) instead.

The fund can cover the costs, in whole or in part, of a participant's hotel, transportation, visa, and event registration for approved events.
Applicants should explore employer-sponsored funding options as their first source of financial support.
Additionally, 25% of the community fund is allocated specifically to support underrepresented groups.
Funding decisions are determined by a combination of need and potential impact.

## Confidentiality

All travel fund requests are treated confidentially: only CPC members and OpenJS Foundation staff have access to the requests. Expense reports are managed according to the Foundation's [Privacy Policy](https://privacy-policy.openjsf.org/).

## Community Fund Rules

Valid travel expenses are:

* Airfare, train, or ferry tickets in economy/coach class only
* Accommodations (dates of the event plus one night prior are eligible for reimbursement)
* Visa fees (even in case the visa is denied)
* Ground transportation to/from the airport

NOTE: Funds may not be used for miscellaneous travel expenses including food, non-airport transportation, baggage fees, etc.
Generally, registration can be reimbursed if the attendee is speaking on behalf of OpenJS, the CPC, or OpenJS-hosted projects.
Funding is not transferable to another person, or any other event. 


## How To Apply

### Submit Travel Fund Request

Submit your travel fund request to the Cross Project Council (CPC) by completing [this application](https://forms.gle/QDt3iqoXXB5Ycovz8).
Please see [Deadlines and Timelines](#deadlines-and-timelines) for information about cut-off dates. 

### Wait For Approval

The CPC will review requests as soon as possible, usually in the next CPC private session (every 2 weeks).
You will be notified by email if your request is approved or denied. Only approved requests are eligible for reimbursement. 

## Getting Reimbursed

### Submitting Expenses

After the event, kindly submit your expenses within 30 days.

> [!Note]
> The faster expenses are submitted, the faster any leftover funds can be reallocated to allow additional people to travel. So **please submit your expenses as quickly as possible**. Thank you! 

* Fill out these [two forms](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E-dTuqnIWpZN2NP-1ioAWzK_W2zSwa_P?usp=share_link)
* Submit the forms along with **all** receipts [here](https://form.asana.com/?k=S6lGzAjHv2uv7M8llnhO_w&d=9283783873717)

Please note that expenses without receipts can not be paid.

### Receiving Payment

Payments are processed within 30 days.

## Deadlines and Timelines

The default deadline for submitting a community fund request is 8 weeks prior to the travel date to allow for all requests for an event to be reviewed at the same time. If you've missed a deadline, or if a deadline was impossible to meet, please submit your request anyway, explaining why you weren't able to meet the deadline if possible.

Some events might have a fixed deadline for applications. Those deadlines will be posted below.

## CPC Review Process

- Pending requests will be sent to the private CPC mailing list prior to the review meeting.
  In the context of the lazy consensus process, the pending request list is a proposal to accept
  all of the requests. CPC members may raise any objections before the scheduled meeting,
  otherwise a final decision to approve a request can be confirmed in the meeting.
- The CPC will use a [scoring rubric](#scoring-rubric) to help with decision making.
- If any requests are rejected, an email with the rejected requests will be sent to the private
  CPC mailing list and CPC members will have 2 days to object before the decision is confirmed.
  Approved requests will be confirmed right away.

### Scoring Rubric

The following rubric is used by the CPC to aid in deciding which requests to approve. The rubric is subject to change. 

Item | Score
-- | --
Reason For Travel: OpenJS Project, Collab Space, or CPC, OpenJS Related Event | +3
Primary Reason For Attendance: Leading, Presenting, Or Panelist | +5
What OpenJS Hosted Project(s) Do You Contribute To (1 or more) | +1
Role: TSC, Core, or Active | +1
DEI: Identifies as from any underrepresented group | +3
Total Amount Requested Less Than X (e.g. $1,500) | +1
