# Cross Project Council Community Fund

## About The Community Fund

The OpenJS Foundation’s community fund supports travel and attendance at events and activities directly related to OpenJS projects, technologies, or goals. We support travel for individuals who are:

* Collaborators
* Standards body participants
* Speakers

The fund can cover the costs, in whole or in part, of a participant's hotel, transportation, and some event registrations.
Applicants should explore employer-sponsored funding options as their first source of financial support.
Additionally, 25% of the community fund is allocated specifically to support underrepresented groups.
Funding decisions are determined by a combination of need and potential impact.

## Transparency

In **2023**, 26 funding requests were made by 22 contributors for a total requested sum of $47,500 with a maximum of 2 requests per contributor.
Requested sums per trip ranged from $750 to $5,750, with a median of $1,525 and an average of $1,825.
Requested sums per individual ranged from $1,000 to $7,350, with a median of $1,950 and an average of $2,150.
All requests were granted.

For 2024, $60,000 was allocated to the fund.

_All ammounts are in United States dollar._

## Community Fund Rules

Valid travel expenses are:

* Airfare, train, or ferry tickets in economy/coach class only
* Accommodations (Dates of the event plus one night prior are eligible for reimbursement)
* Ground transportation to/from the airport

NOTE: Funds may not be used for miscellaneous travel expenses including food, visa costs, non-airport transportation, baggage fees, etc.
Generally, registration can be reimbursed if the attendee is speaking on behalf of OpenJS, the CPC, or OpenJS-hosted projects.
Funding is not transferable to another person, or any other event.
