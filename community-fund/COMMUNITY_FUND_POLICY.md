# Cross Project Council Community Fund

## About The Community Fund

The OpenJS Foundationâ€™s community fund supports travel and attendance at events and activities directly related to OpenJS projects, technologies, or goals. We support travel for individuals who are:

* Collaborators
* Standards body participants
* Speakers

The fund can cover the costs, in whole or in part, of a participant's hotel, transportation, and some event registrations.
Applicants should explore employer-sponsored funding options as their first source of financial support.
Additionally, 25% of the community fund is allocated specifically to support underrepresented groups.
Funding decisions are determined by a combination of need and potential impact.

## Transparency

In **2023**, 26 funding requests were made by 22 contributors for a total requested sum of $47,500 with a maximum of 2 requests per contributor.
Requested sums per trip ranged from $750 to $5,750, with a median of $1,525 and an average of $1,825.
Requested sums per individual ranged from $1,000 to $7,350, with a median of $1,950 and an average of $2,150.
All requests were granted.

For 2024, $60,000 was allocated to the fund.

_All ammounts are in United States dollar._

## Community Fund Rules

Valid travel expenses are:

* Airfare, train, or ferry tickets in economy/coach class only
* Accommodations (Dates of the event plus one night prior are eligible for reimbursement)

NOTE: Funds may not be used for miscellaneous travel expenses including food, visa costs, non-airport transportation, baggage fees, etc.
