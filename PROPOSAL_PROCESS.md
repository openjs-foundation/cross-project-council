# Proposal Process

Anyone may submit an idea for a policy or program following the proposal process outlined below. To submit an idea, create a folder in the appropriate
directory found in `./proposals`, update [proposals/README.md](./README.md), submit a pull-request, and apply the appropriate proposal label.

For incubating proposals a README.md is sufficient, for later stages please include the appropriate supporting documents as well.

The proposal will be evaluated at bootstrap committee meetings and stage changes will occur at those times.

## Incubating Proposal

An initial PR is created to incubate/refine a proposal until it is ready to be approved adopted. Before landing it needs to have
an identified 'champion' (this can be anybody) who will be pushing the proposal through to its conclusion.

They should have a rough description of the program idea or policy, what resources would be needed to execute it, what committee or role
is responsible for overseeing it, ideas for metrics, execution, and so forth. They have clear language about which group or groups
the program/policy will serve. The purpose of this stage is to capture the spirit of an idea the community may want to explore
further, and to begin thinking about implementation ideas or process questions that need to be answered. 

The PR should include a new directory in the proposals directory titled for the proposal with a README.md with the outline 
for the proposal.

An incubating proposal can be updated through as many PRs as you’d like, essentially providing snapshots

## Ready for Approval

When ready a new PR is created to move an incubating proposal to the ready for approval by the CPC and if necessary the board.
Proposals in this stage are written up in the style of the formal policy or program language. They include examples of the
program idea or policy in action, with clear steps and guidelines. They include the steps that will need to be taken to
initially implement the idea or policy. 

The purpose of this stage is to refine the policy, make sure all
stakeholders (potentially including the board) have had a chance to review and request changes, and determine whether further iteration is needed. 

The PR should include:
  * moving the new artifacts into place (for example into the top level of the CPC repo). 
  * moving the directory the proposal into the Approved directory within the proposals directory
  
Once the PR lands the proposal is considered complete and in place.
