# ${PROJECT} Charter

_note: the purpose of a project charter is to provide a brief introduction_
_to the project from a technical and community perspective. The_ 
_document also connects a project's community leadership and governance with the_
_OpenJS Foundation's governance._

## Section 0: Guiding Principles (optional)

_directions: provide a concise, high-level statement about_
_the project's long-term principles, values, or mission._

ex. [Electron Governance Charter](https://github.com/electron/governance/tree/main/charter#core-values)

## Section 1: Scope

_directions: Include a 3-4 sentence summary of what the project does,_
_and/or what problems it solves. Imagine trying to explain your work_
_to a colleague who is familiar with related technical concepts but unfamiliar_
_with the project. You may also want to describe the project's value to community_
_and/or business stakeholders._

ex. [K8s SIG Architecture Charter](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/HEAD/sig-architecture/charter.md#scope)

### 1.1: In-scope (optional)

_directions: list or bullet out problem spaces, use cases, repositories_
_or other projects which are included with the work but may not be readily_
_apparent. This may help differentiate the project from other solutions in the_
_space. If you are not using this section, please indicate your intent with the_
_phrase, 'Section Intentionally Left Blank'._

### 1.2: Out-of-Scope (optional)

_directions: list or bullet out areas that may be seen to be related but are_
_not included in the scope of this project. This may help clarify the kind of_
_features, contributions, issues or problems the project is looking for._
_If you are not using this section, please indicate your intent with the_
_phrase, 'Section Intentionally Left Blank'._
