# Cross Project Council (CPC) Charter

## Section 1. Guiding Principle.

The _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation will operate transparently, openly,
collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status
must not merely be open, but also easily visible to outsiders.

## Section 2. Evolution of _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation Governance.

Most large, complex open source communities have both a business and a
technical governance model. _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation’s technical leadership
is the Cross Project Council (“CPC”). _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation’s business
leadership is the Board of Directors (the “Board”).

This Cross Project Council Charter reflects a carefully
constructed balanced role for the CPC and the Board in the governance of
_$FOUNDATION_ Foundation. The charter amendment process is for the
_$FOUNDATION_ to propose changes using simple majority of the
full _$FOUNDATION_, the proposed changes being subject to review
and approval by the Board. The Board may additionally make amendments to
the _$FOUNDATION_ charter at any time, though the Board will not interfere
with day-to-day discussions, votes or meetings
of the CPC.

## Section 3. Board’s Role in Setting _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation’s Strategic Direction. 

The Board will set the overall CPC Policy. The policy will describe the
overarching scope of the _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation initiative, _$FOUNDATION_ 
Foundation’s technical vision and direction and project release
expectations in the form of expected cadence and intent. The Board will
use the CPC as a delegate body for governing technical implementation,
individual project scope and direction while they remain within the scope
and direction of the policies as described in the CPC Policy document and
approved by the Board.

The Board sets the overall CPC policy through [Foundation mission and vision
statements][] as well as within the [Foundation bylaws][]. The policy describes
the overarching scope of the _$FOUNDATION_ initiatives , technical vision,
and direction. The Board uses the CPC as a delegate body for governing
high-level technical policy and procedures while remaining within the scope and
direction of the policies set by the Board.


## Section 4. Establishment of the CPC.

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> Node.js

CPC memberships are not time-limited. There is no maximum size of the CPC.
The size is expected to vary in order to ensure adequate coverage of important
areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently.
The CPC must have at least three members.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for CPC
membership beyond these rules. The CPC may add additional members to the
CPC by a standard CPC motion and vote. A CPC member may be removed from the
CPC by voluntary resignation, by a standard CPC motion, or in accordance to the
participation rules described below.

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> JS Foundation

TAC memberships are time-limited to 1 year terms with no limit on the number of
terms a member may serve. The TAC will be limited to 25 voting seats and
membership of the TAC will consist of:

1. One representative from each JS Foundation Platinum Member organization.
2. One representative from the Node.js Foundation. See the [Ecosystem
Mentorship][] section below for details concerning the relationship between the
JS Foundation and the Node.js Foundation.
3. Individuals from the greater JS community as appointed by the existing TAC
and the Board. This includes JS Foundation Project representatives as nominated
by Projects that have completed and graduated from the mentorship process.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for TAC membership
beyond these rules. The TAC and the Board may add additional members from the JS
community to the TAC by  following the election process as described in the
[Elections][] section of this charter. A TAC member, including those appointed
by Projects and Member organizations may be removed from the TAC by voluntary
resignation, or by a standard TAC motion and vote. If the removed member is a
Project or Member organization representative, that Project or Member
organization may appoint a new representative. The removed member may again be
considered for addition to the TAC after a term of 1 year from their removal. At
the end of a member's term, that term may be renewed for an additional term by a
standard TAC motion and vote.

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> CNCF

  * The TOC shall be composed of at most nine (9) members.

  * TOC members elected are expected to cover key technical domains: container technologies, operating systems, technical operations, distributed systems, user level application design, etc.

  * The Governing Board shall elect six (6) TOC members, the End User TAB shall elect one (1) TOC member and the initial seven TOC members shall elect an additional two (2) TOC members.

* Criteria for Nomination. Nominees for the TOC shall:
  * commit that they have the available bandwidth to make the time to invest in the CNCF TOC, including a considerable early investment as the CNCF is formed and then ongoing investment of time to prepare and review in advance of quarterly TOC meetings,

  * demonstrate advanced level of professional experience as engineers in the scope of CNCF,

  * demonstrate seniority sufficient to access additional staff or community members to assist in their TOC preparations, and\\ iv. operate neutrally in discussions and put the goals and success of CNCF in balance with corporate objectives or any particular project in CNCF.

* Process for TOC Member Nominations and Election

 * The TOC shall be composed of nine (9) TOC members: six (6) elected by the Governing Board, one (1) selected by the End User TAB and two (2) elected by the initial seven TOC members.

 * Nominations: Each CNCF member may nominate up to two (2) technical representatives, (from vendors, end users or any other fields), at most one of which may be from their respective company. The nominee(s) must agree to participate prior to being added to the nomination list.

 * The initial seven (7) TOC members (the six elected by the Governing Board plus one (1) elected by the End User TAB) shall then nominate and elect two (2) additional TOC members using the Nomination Process.

 * A nomination requires a maximum one (1) page nomination pitch which should include the nominees name, contact information and supporting statement identifying the nominees experience in CNCF domains.

Each nominee shall require support of over 50% majority of those voting to validate the nominee meets the qualification criteria. Nominees passing with a majority vote shall be Qualified Nominees.

  * If the number of Qualified Nominees are equal to or less than the number of TOC seats available to be elected, the Qualified Nominees shall be approved after the nomination period has closed. If there are more Qualified Nominees than open TOC seats available for election by either the the Governing Board, End User TAB or TOC, then that group shall elect the TOC members via a Condorcet vote. A Condorcet vote shall be run using the Condorcet-IRV method through the Cornell online service ([*http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/*](http://civs.cs.cornell.edu/)).

No more than one-fourth of the CPC members may be affiliated with the
same employer. If removal or resignation of a CPC member, or a change of
employment by a CPC member, creates a situation where more than
one-fourth of the CPC membership shares an employer, then the situation
must be immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more
PC

The CPC may, at its discretion, invite any number of non-voting observers to
participate in the public portion of CPC discussions and meetings.

The CPC shall meet regularly using tools that enable participation by the
community. The meeting shall be directed by
the CPC Chairperson. Responsibility for directing individual meetings may be
delegated by the CPC Chairperson to any other CPC member. Minutes or an
appropriate recording shall be taken and made available to the community
through accessible public postings.

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> Node.js

CPC members are expected to regularly participate in CPC activities.
In the case where an individual CPC member -- within any three month period --

participate in CPC discussions, *and* does not participate in CPC votes, the
member shall be automatically removed from the CPC. The member may be invited
to continue attending CPC meetings as an observer.

Section 5. Responsibilities and Expectations of the CPC

Subject to such policies as may be set by the Board, the CPC is responsible for
ensuring: 

   * ensuring collaboration is the driving principle within a Project, between
     _$FOUNDATION_ Projects, and between _$FOUNDATION_ Projects and the broader
     community.
   * defining and maintaining neutral consensus for the technical vision for the _$FOUNDATION_
   * approving new projects within the scope for _$FOUNDATION_ set by the Governing Board,
     as outlined in [XXXX], and creating conceptual architecture for how the proejcts
     fit together.
   * aligning projects, removing or archiving projects, as outlined in [XXXX].
   * approving funds for budgets delegated to the project. A good example is the
     travel fund.
   * follow and be up to date on Board/$FOUNDATION initiatives and communicate them to the projects.
   * defining common practices to be implemented across _$FOUNDATION_ projects, if any.
   * The CPC is also responsible for mediating technical conflicts between
     _$FOUNDATION_ Projects when attempts to resolve those conflicts within the Project
   were unsuccessful. 
   * The CPC serves as the _$FOUNDATION_'s primary technical
     liaison body with external open source projects, consortiums and groups and is
     also responsible for ensuring that the _$FOUNDATION_ has appropriate technical
     participation in standards bodies by finding an encouraging projects members to
     particiapte in these bodies.
   * Members of the CPC, or committees consisting of subsets of the CPC
     membership will be expected to meet on a regular basis to discuss topics
     such as new project acceptance into the mentorship program, project graduation
     from the mentorship program, Project issues and conflicts, opportunities
     for collaboration between Projects, opportunities for the Foundation in the
     greater JavaScript community, etc.
     
## Section 6. Non-Responsibilities of the CPC

_$FOUNDATION_ Projects are self-governing entities. All policies and procedures for interacting with, contributing to and making decisions within a Project are defined, implemented, and documented by that Project’s maintainers and community during the mentorship process. Specific technical decisions within a Project will be the responsibility of the Project and establishment and implementation of the decision making process will be done within the guidelines as defined by CPC charter. Those Project decisions and responsibilities include but are not limited to:

* Setting release dates.
* Release quality standards.
* Technical direction.
* Project governance and process.
* GitHub repository hosting.
* Conduct guidelines.
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators.
* Development process and any coding standards.
* Mediating technical conflicts between Collaborators.


Not withstanding the above, the Projects and the entire technical community will follow any processes
as may be specified by the Board relating to the intake and license compliance review of contributions,
including the _$FOUNDATION_ IP Policy.

## Section 7. Elections

Leadership roles in _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation will be peer elected
representatives of the community.

For election of persons (such as the CPC Chairperson), a multiple-candidate
method should be used, such as:

* [Condorcet][] or
* [Single Transferable Vote][]

Multiple-candidate methods may be reduced to simple election by plurality
when there are only two candidates for one position to be filled. No
election is required if there is only one candidate and no objections to
the candidates election. Elections shall be done within the Projects by
the Collaborators active in the Project.


\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> Node.js
The CPC will elect from amongst voting CPC members a CPC Chairperson to
work on building an agenda for CPC meetings and a CPC Director to represent
the CPC to the Board for a term of one year according to the _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation’s
By-laws. The Chair and Director may be (but are not required to be)
the same person. The CPC shall hold annual elections to select a CPC
Chairperson and Director; there are no limits on the number of terms a
CPC Chairperson or Director may serve.

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> JS Foundation
Each Project that has graduated from the mentorship program may nominate a representative to be appointed to the CPC. Elections shall be done within the Projects by the Collaborators active in the Project.

Foundation supporting Member organizations may elect representatives to the CPC and may use whatever means they deem fit to determine the individuals who will fill those roles in accordance with the limits set forth in the Establishment of the CPC section above.

The TAC will elect from amongst voting CPC members a CPC Chairperson to work on building an agenda for CPC meetings and represent the CPC to the Board of Directors for a term of one year according to the JS Foundation's By-laws. The CPC shall hold annual elections to select a CPC Chairperson; there are no limits on the number of terms a CPC Chairperson may serve.

====================

## Section 8. Decision Making

For internal Project decisions, Collaborators shall operate under Lazy
Consensus. The CPC follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. When
an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does
anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a CPC member can call for either a
closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting. Votes shall
follow the procedure described in the [Voting][] section of this charter.

## Section 9. Voting

The CPC follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. When an agenda
item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does anyone
object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a CPC member can call for
either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting.
The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the CPC or else the
discussion will continue.

For all votes, a simple majority of all CPC members for, or against, the issue
wins. A CPC member may choose to participate in any vote through abstention.

Note that, in addition to requiring a simple majority vote of the CPC, all
changes to this charter are also subject to approval from the _$FOUNDATION_
Foundation board.

## Section 10. Definitions

Collaborator by the Project's Maintainers. Contributors should rarely be
encumbered by the TAC or Board.

**Collaborator**: a Contributor within a Project that has made significant and
valuable contributions and has been given commit-access to that Project
repository.
