# Joint Foundation Bootstrap Team

For the current list of Team members, see the project
[README.md](./README.md).

## Members

The [nodejs/bootstrap](https://github.com/nodejs/bootstrap) GitHub
repository is maintained by the Team and additional Members who are
added on an ongoing basis.

## Team Membership

Team Membership is not time-limited. There is no fixed size of the Team.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for Team Membership beyond these rules.

The following groups automatically have membership and can request to be added to the github team:

* Node.js Members: @nodejs/members
* JSF Project Maintainers
* JSF TAC
* Node.js Foundation Board of Directors
* JSF Board of Directors

## Team Meetings

The Team meets weekly on Zoom.us. A designated moderator
approved by the Team runs the meeting. Each meeting should be
published to YouTube.

Items are added to the Team agenda that are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, Team membership,
or release process.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;
that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
group of Collaborators.

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
Team member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the ***bootstrap-agenda*** tag to the issue.

Prior to each Team meeting the moderator will share the agenda with
members of the Team. Team members can add any items they like to the
agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the Team
cannot veto or remove items.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each
agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.

## Consensus Seeking Process

The Team follows a
[Consensus Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)
decision-making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus, the moderator
will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus, a Team member can call for
the item to be decided by a vote or to table the issue to the next
meeting. In both cases the decision must be seconded by a majority of the Team
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins. Only Active
Members participate in a vote.
