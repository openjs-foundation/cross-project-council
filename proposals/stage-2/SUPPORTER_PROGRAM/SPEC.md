## October 2020

### Phase 1 Components

**A Logo and Badge

Inspirations and Suggestions:
* An anthropromorphic passport, with JS branding
* A little playful
* Give him -
* Binocs
* Fanny pack
* Tourguide flags
* Map
* Passport person is traveling to see everything, doesn’t have a destination
* Topography instead of countries
* Play on the passport is the digital badge


Logo Things to avoid:

* Transportation mediums
* Anything that suggests nationalism/closed borders
* Anything that suggests a certain nationality or race
* Something too esoteric
* Maps or directions that get you to a certain destination

### Open Questions

Should the logo and badge be different?
