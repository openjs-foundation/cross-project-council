## Description

Supporter program for OpenJS individual supporters. 

## Who would be responsible?

The CPC would own the maintenance and sustainability of the program with OpenJS Foundation staff support along with iterating on the program and ensuring the supporter needs are heard and accounted for. 

## How would success be measured?

* Growth of the supporter list
* Quantifiable public advocacy from supporters for the OpenJS Foundation and projects
* An increase in contributors to projects from small to large
* More attendees at weekly CPC meetings, and additional CPC members

## What is necessary to complete this proposal

Approval of this proposal from project members of the NF and JSF, the Node.js Board of Directors, and the JSF Board of Directors

## Open Questions

* What should the income from the supporter program go towards? 
* What should the landing page be like, can we give supporters "passports"?
* Should we auutomatically re-charge supporters at the end of a calendar year? 

## Timeline

Our goal to roll out this program will be Q4, permitting everything goes smoothly.
