## Description


The formation of the OpenJS Foundation was in support of a number of goals. 
The first was to support JavaScript projects, providing a neutral place for people to collaborate and resources needed by those projects (legal, marketing, best practices governance support, infra, etc.).

Good progress has been made on this front with governance for accepting and onboarding projects having been defined and the first projects working through the process.

The second goal was to foster greater collaboration in the JavaScript ecosystem.  Bringing
projects together in a single Foundation provides an easier path to collaboration between projects. We see this collaboration starting,  for example, in the formation of the Standards
working group. However, I feel support for collaboration efforts should be broader than that scope.

The OpenJS Foundation should act as a neutral place for people to collaborate on areas of
importance to the JavaScript ecosystem. In some cases, this may align with projects and in
other cases be independent of the member projects. Regardless of the alignment with existing
member projects, the OpenJS Foundation should provide support for collaboration in
a particular area.  Support could include but not be limited to:
* a repo in the OpenJS org
* marketing support
* mailing lists
* slack channels
* etc.
* representation on the CPC

In the same way, as we have a process/governance for reviewing projects that wish to join
the Foundation we could have process/governance for applications to start a new
`OpenJS Collaboration Space`.  Those submitting the application need not be within
member projects and the application would be reviewed/accepted by the CPC as is the
case with projects.

My hope is that this approach would help provide more focus/support for collaboration
as an effort independent from member projects.

Some of the `Collaboration Spaces` that I could envision include:

* Security 
* Test
* Runtimes (Node.js, electron, WASI, etc/.)
* Web Frameworks (Express, Fastify, Hapi, etc.)
* JavaScript Standards (existing Standards team?)
* Package management (npm, yarn)
* Registries, local caches
* Package ecosystem (Package-maintenance team in Node.js ?)


One key question is if this would better support collaboration versus just
adopting `Working Group` governance along the lines of what was supported
in the Node.js space. One area that would be different is that responsibility
would not necessarily be delegated from the CPC, as the "Space" might cover
an area with is outside the charter of the CPC, much like responsibility the
work in a specific project is outside the scope of the CPC.
