## The People's Community of JavaScriptlandia 

JavaScriptLandia is a place where all JavaScript developers, whether if you're all about TypeScript, a React evangelist, or you stick to Node.js, gather to declare their support for the JavaScript ecosystem and OpenJS. 

It's an Individual Supporter Program whose goals are to help bring awareness about OpenJS projects to possible contributors. A way for individuals to show support and be a part of the OpenJS foundation, as well as providing an opportunity for community with the other members. 

While one goal of this group is introducing members to projects and helping the projects find the support they need; the supporter program will also be an opportunity to welcome an inclusive group of coders from around the world that love the projects that are part of the OpenJS foundation. This also brings in new perspectives and feedback from the vast community of JavaScript developers.

We also want to grow awareness of OpenJS, our projects, and how to get involved. 

Additionally, being an Individual supporter should help people understand that their projects can also get support from the foundation, and that the OpenJS Foundation is their Foundation. 

A tertiary goal is to establish a pool from which an ambassador program can be started. Recognizing people that evangelize and recruit for OpenJS projects. 

## Supporter Benefits

Citizens of JavaScriptlandia will receive a supporters' weekly newsletter keeping them up to date on the last from OpenJS projects, the CPC, and the board. They will be invited to participate in discussions about governance and new initiatives. 

They will be featured on our global supporter page, and will be given a digital passport that they can put on an avatar, their blog, and/or personal website. Their passport will feature the libaries that they use the most, and the ones that are the biggest fans of. 

There will be a repository for supporters, and they will be able to display their badge proudly on their Github profile. Supporters can incubate projects in that repository (this should have discussion).

Additionally, they will receive discounts for training, certification, conferences, and potentially exclusive offers from member organizations. 

Lastly, supporters will have access to the supporter store where they can purchase OpenJS supporter swag to show their support for our projects. Revenue from swag will go towards furthering the reach of the foundation.
