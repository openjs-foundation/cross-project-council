### [2018 funds](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/TravelFunds/2018.md)

## Requirements

* Candidates must be an active participant of one of the projects of the OpenJS Foundation. //TODO clarify?
* Those requesting funds must indicate that they do not have funding available from another source, such as an employer or
the event itself that might cover costs for presenters.

## Process

Requests must be made prior to the start of travel. Requests submitted once travel is complete will not be approved.

It is strongly recommended that you submit your request far enough in advance to get approval before making relevant expenditures.
Review of requests will take at least 72 hours and may take considerably longer. Note, with limited funds available, approval is not
guaranteed. If a request is rejected, reimbursement will not be issued.The Foundation cannot pre-pay for travel expenditures.

## Visa Tips

// TODO make email alias for visa help
For all events, 3rd party or hosted Foundation events, it is recommended to apply for a visa at least 6 months prior to an event.

### For Industry Events

If you need a visa for the country in which the OpenJSF event you are attending is being held,
[see the document on preparing for a visa application](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/travel-visas.md). //TODO update link

### What The Foundation Can Do To Help:

//TODO update link
The Foundation [provides guidance on preparing your visa application](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/travel-visas.md),
including information on visa processing times and a checklist of items that a visa application could require.

For Foundation-hosted events, OpenJS Foundation provides a visa letter by The Linux Foundation (does not guarantee visa approval).
Click [here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-js-interactive-2018/attend/visa-request/) to request a visa letter.

### What the Foundation Cannot Do:

Please note that unless the Foundation is specifically hosting the event, we cannot help with visa letters.
The Foundation is also not able to contact consulates. When the Foundation has done this in the past, our efforts have been unsuccessful
and/or we’ve lacked the expertise to be effective.  

For additional information on preparing your visa application or requesting a visa letter, please email
[visainfo@openjsf.org](mailto:visainfo@openjsf.org).

## Requesting Travel Funds

* Open a pull request that adds an entry to the appropriate year's file
  * Include as many fields as possible:
    * The name of the event you plan to attend.
    * The location, dates of the event and where you will be traveling from.
    * The presentation you intend to give, if applicable.
    * The size of the stipend you wish to receive.
      * In the pull request description, explain how you calculated your
        stipend. For example, include estimates for airfare, hotel, other
        transportation, and so on. The total amount should be your stipend
        request.
      * In the PR description, mention @openjs-foundation/cpc.
    * Once the final amount spent is known, update the table again with that information.
    * Certain details of your request (such as the column for date sent to finance) may be unknown initially; these can be filled in and updated during the process of reconciliation.

## Approval

A request is approved when all of the following criteria are met:

* The pull request has been open for at least 72 hours.
* The request has approval from at least four members of @openjs-foundation/cpc.
* No members of @openjs-foundation/cpc have objected to the request.
* The pull request has been merged. Any member may merge once other prerequisites have been met.

If a request is blocked by an objection from a member of @openjs-foundation/cpc, then the only way for the request
to be approved is for that committee to decide to approve the request using whatever decision-making process the committee uses when
consensus is not reached.

As examples, the purpose of prior sponsored travels includes attending TC39 meetings,
attending [OpenJS collaboration summits](https://github.com/nodejs/summit), and
mentoring [Code and Learn](https://github.com/nodejs/code-and-learn).

### Considerations for approval of a request

#### Impact
* Preference is given to events hosted or sponsored by the OpenJS Foundation. For example, OpenJS Collaboration summits and Diagnostics summits should be given precedence because they bring together members of the Foundation to help the Foundation projects advance.
* Preference is given to speakers and panelists of a conference. Speaking and doing panels at a conference generates a more
significant impact than attending. However, individuals applying for the travel fund to speak or participate in panels should confirm that the event organizers cannot cover the travel expenses before submitting a request.

#### Outreach
* Preference is given to underserved communities. More specifically, within a subject the foundation is trying to promote awareness
about (e.g. general knowledge about the Foundation) there are people, communities, and geographies where that knowledge is not very
widespread. This is where preference will be given. For instance, an event in San Francisco would be less attractive than an event of the same size in Kansas City.

#### Cost
* The larger the stipend the more critically the travel fund admins will consider the request and application.
The budget for this program is a finite resource.

#### Equity
* Preference is given to individuals who cannot receive travel funding from their employers or individuals who have not previously received a stipend.

## Reimbursement

So that we can reimburse you more quickly, we strongly encourage you to use
[Expensify](https://expensify.com) to organize and submit your receipts.  Please
see our [guide to creating and configuring a free Expensify
account](./reimbursement_process.pdf).

Here are the highlights of the process:

* A free [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/) account is sufficient.
* You can use the Android and iOS apps to capture receipts while you are
  traveling.  If you do not use the app, you will need to upload photos of your
  receipts after you return.
* When you add an expense, please use local currency so that it matches the
  amount on the receipt.
* Once you have uploaded your receipts, please add them to a report and submit
  it with [operations@openjsf.org](mailto:operations@openjsf.org) on cc, and the
  Memo field set to "YOURNAME - TRIPNAME".

When we receive your report, we will send you a form via DocuSign to collect
your payment details.  At that point, you're done.

### Alternate process

If you decide not to use Expensify, the reimbursement process is manual and may
take longer for us to process.  You can email a zip file of your receipts and
the completed [Expense Report](./expense-report-template.xls?raw=true), renamed
as ExpenseReport-OpenJS-EVENTNAME-YOURNAME-YYYYMM.xls, to
[operations@openjsf.org](mailto:operations@openjsf.org).  Please send the file
as a spreadsheet, not as a PDF.  We will send it back to you for signature in
DocuSign.

### Important:

* Expense reports must be submitted within 30 days of event date. Any reports submitted after 30 days may not be reimbursed.
* Disbursements are generally processed within 30 days.
* We are unable to pre-pay for expenses.
* The Cross Project Council representative to the Board of Directors will report back amounts consumed from the travel allocation on a monthly basis to the Board.
