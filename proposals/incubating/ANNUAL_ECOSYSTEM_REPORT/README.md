## **Description**

This proposal contemplates the creation of **an annual open poll** capturing relevant data and opinions from the JavaScript ecosystem end-users **and a final report** including collected data and adding a comprehensive statement with pertinent information from the OpenJS Foundation and its member projects.

This comprehensive report should present a detailed look into the OpenJS Foundation's entire portfolio, shedding light on each open-source JavaScript member project's progress, plans, and potential. It also delves into feedback gathered from the open poll, ensuring the voices of JavaScript ecosystem end-users are heard. Readers can expect insights on milestones achieved, future roadmaps, recommended best practices, specific project requests to end-users, and recommendations from the OpenJS Foundation.

This effort will aim at nurturing the healthy evolution of the open-source JavaScript ecosystem and web technologies and establish a channel to get end-users feedback and more involvement with the OpenJS Foundation.

## **Required Resources**

* Project Management support from the OpenJS Foundation
* Budget for the design and distribution of the end-user poll
* Design and distribution support from the OpenJS Foundation marketing staff

## **Who would be responsible?**

* The CPC would overview the process
* A new working group should be created, and its responsibilities will be:
    * Work on designing the end-user poll
    * Create the format for all member projects to report their details
    * Work with the member projects to get the report done
    * In case of not getting the report from a project, the working group will create a report based on the information available
* The OpenJS Foundation marketing staff would design and distribute the end-user poll and the final unified report.

## **How would success be measured?**

* Number of end-users that participate in the poll
* Distribution stats of the final report
* An increase in contributors to projects from small to large

## **Why this proposal is important**

* Currently, the connection with the end-users from the OpenJS Foundation needs to be stronger. This proposal will help better understand the end-user's needs and how the OpenJS Foundation can help fulfill them.
* It will help to get end-users feedback and more involvement with the OpenJS Foundation, which will help to nurture the healthy evolution of the open-source JavaScript ecosystem and web technologies.
* It will help get a panoramic view of the OpenJS Foundation's portfolio, detailing all project members' progress, plans, and prospects.
* It will build trust and confidence in the OpenJS Foundation and its project members.
* It will provide a channel to give recommendations to end-users from the OpenJS Foundation and its member projects.

## **Unresolved Question**

* What should be the protocol to reach the open-source project members to get the report done?
* What should the deadline be for the open-source project members to complete the report?
* What should be the timeline for the report?
* What should be the timeline for the end-user poll?
* What should be the timeline for the final report?
