managing Code of Conducts within the Foundation.

## Required Resources

Discussion/approval by bootstrap committee

## Who would be responsible?

In current proposals for the groups within a merged
foundation, the responsibility would be a joint
responsibility of the Foundation, Board, CPC, and projects.

## How would success be measured?

Success is incorporation of the content within this document
either as the document itself or incorporate into one
of the other Governance documents for the foundation.

## Why this proposal is important

We need to agree on the requirements a Code of Conduct
as part of the requirements for projects joining the
foundation.

## What is neccessary to complete this proposal

## Further questions

### Other thoughts to consider later on
* Form: It would be easier on the reportee to have a form template to help them structure their report. The form submission could trigger an email. TODO: copy for a form.
* Repo: openjs/moderation (not provisioned). As commented in PR review, hosting sensitive personal information on GitHub needs due consideration, review, and possibly legal consultation.
* Beacon project
* Code of Conduct Project: A cross-project collaboration between multiple open source tech communities (RxJS, AngularJS, Node.js, Vue.js, etc.) to find consensus on Code of Conducts. Progress is rapid and can add definition to our own process (where possible) within 6 months. Recommend incorporating the findings and avoid duplication of effort.
