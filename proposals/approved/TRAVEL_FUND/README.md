# OpenJS Travel Fund

## Description

The Node.js organizations that existed prior to the formation of the OpenJS foundation oversaw a monetary fund for the purpose of member and affiliate travel to, and lodging at, events related to the foundation's mission. This proposal proposes moving the management responsibilities of this fund to the Cross Project Council (CPC), and making the funds available to all members of this broader organization. Since all projects have voting representation on the CPC, the beneficiaries of the fund will jointly manage it, and the previous owners of the fund will still vote on its use.

We shall review the process in this proposal, but the intent is to leave the mechanics of the fund unchanged, simply moving from the purview of the Node.js project into the domain of the OpenJS Foundation, overseen by the CPC. This operation can be viewed as a refactor which moves the travel fund up one level in the organizational tree.

The current fund is used mostly for attending collaborator summits, and we do not expect this to change.

## Difference from the current process

The existing process requires approval from two members of the [Node.js TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) and two members of the [Node.js Community Committee](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee).
The new process will require approval from four members of the CPC.

The role of fund "treasurer" will be removed, as it has been found to be redundant and is not currently filled (see https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/268#issuecomment-513888283).

The suggestion to submit a "trip report" after travel has been removed. No trip reports have been submitted in the past year.

## Who qualifies for using the Travel Fund?

As the document currently states:
> * Candidates must be an active participant of one of the projects of the OpenJS Foundation.
> * Those requesting funds must indicate that they do not have funding available from another source, such as an employer or
>   the event itself that might cover costs for presenters.

This means, any project in the Foundation, no matter the level.
For each project, any active participant is welcome to apply for funds. This would mean any contributor or someone active in the community. Their participation should be self-evident (github activity, etc), and if in doubt their project representative can be asked to confirm.

## Practical Specifics

> **Note:** This section has been updated to include the updated links, pointing to where they live in the OpenJS Foundation organization rather than the dead links in the Node.js organization. See the previous commit to the following lines file if you'd like to see the original, broken links.

- Modify these files to account for OpenJS Foundation rather than Node.js organizations
  - https://github.com/openjs-foundation/community-fund/blob/main/programs/travel-fund/README.md
  - https://github.com/openjs-foundation/community-fund/blob/main/programs/travel-fund/travel-visas.md

- Remove mentions from nodejs/admin README, add links to CPC README

## Required Resources

@brianwarner reports that everything can stay the same for the tools and accounts involved.
 - add email: visainfo@openjsf.org and travelapprovals@openjsf.org
Some data on past fund usage, and data from the OpenJS projects on predicted fund usage.

## How would success be measured?

Success will be achieved if Node.js and non-Node.js members use the travel fund to attend a Foundation-related event, and nobody notices the difference.

## Why this proposal is important

The Node.js project has demonstrated the value of providing a travel fund which allows project members to get together at collaborator summits and to represent/advocate for the project at other events. It is important to expand the travel fund (both resource and usage) so that other projects can benefit as well.

## Unresolved Questions



## What is necessary to complete this proposal

- Approval and buy-in from Node.js TSC and CommComm.
- OpenJS board approval
- Definition and wording of the travel fund mechanics, mostly moving files and updating references.
- Update 2019.md to include expenses made during this proposal process in nodejs/admin/travelfunds/2019.md
