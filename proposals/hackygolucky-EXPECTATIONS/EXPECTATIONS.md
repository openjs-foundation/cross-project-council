## Expectations

With the intent to merge the Node.js Foundation and JS Foundation being announced, those interested in the continued support of Node.js and JS-related projects are working through expectations and structure for what the potential new foundation could look like.

This document is for the initial phase of work for the Bootstrap team to draft requirements that overlap with scope of the Board in order to provide an outline and structure for the foundation attuned to the needs of the projects and ecosystem stakeholders who have participated.

This document is organized by two key areas: concerns that must be included in the foundation bylaws, and those that are communicated expectations that aren't required to be in our legal documents to proceed but are vital to managing expectations of project members and ecosystem stakeholders.

### Bylaws requirements
- Communicated scope for the foundation and board 
- Annual reviews of staff, NPS, board, programs, support services to projects for accountability and incremental improvement 
- The foundation staff, executive director, and board should follow a leadership style that prioritizes and promotes the well-being of the project and those who prioritize and promote a healthy project and ecosystem. 
- Project representation on the Board where the broader and longer-term issues important to the success of the overall JavaScript ecosystem can discussed, championed and supported
    - Community Representation should sit on the Board directly. Projects could share this representation. 
    - Community representation on the Board: 3 seats guaranteed for community representation

##### Mission Statement Drafts
Projects joining the foundation should collectively agree on a _single mission statement_ when joining the new Foundation. Below are a number of rough drafts put forward by attendees of the Governance breakout session(s) at our Node.js Collaborator Summit 2018 in Vancouver.

 > By providing structure and support to build and sustain community among open-source projects.

 > Growing and maintaining the global JavaScript system through open, equitable, and inclusive governance.

 > The Foundation is dedicated to the development and sustainability of the JavaScript ecosystem, through fostering the environment for growth of JavaScript related projects.

 > The Foundation envisions a future where JavaScript is a sustainable platform for implementing best in class experiences in production across all types of workloads. The $FOUNDATION is committed to being a catalyst across the industry making our technological communities productive, sustainable, equitable, diverse and inclusive.

##### Vision Statement Drafts

###### Transparent Operation
