# Minimum security reporting requirements for OpenJS Foundation projects

## Security policy

Each OpenJS Foundation project must publish a security policy in an easily accessible place. The recommended approach is to [publish the security policy in each GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository).

Projects that have their own organization on GitHub are advised to place the `SECURITY.md` file in the `.github` repository for the organization.

## Reporting

Project security policy should explain how to confidentially report a security vulnerability.

Each project should support at least one security reporting channel. Common ways of accepting vulnerability reports are:

1. Designated email address, e.g. `security@example.com`.
1. Vulnerability disclosure program, e.g. hosted on platform such as [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/product/community) or similar.

Projects that have their own reporting channels are encouraged to continue using them and document it in the security policy.
