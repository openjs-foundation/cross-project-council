# The OpenJS Collaboration Network

The formation of the OpenJS Foundation was in support of a number of goals.
The first was to support JavaScript projects, providing a neutral place for people to collaborate and resources needed by those projects (legal, marketing, best practices governance support, infra, etc.).

The second goal was to foster greater collaboration in the JavaScript ecosystem.
Bringing projects together in a single Foundation provides an easier path to collaboration between projects.

The OpenJS Collaboration network provides the framework for people to collaborate on areas of importance to the JavaScript ecosystem in a neutral space.
In some cases, this may align with projects and in other cases be independent of the member projects.
Regardless of the alignment with existing member projects, the OpenJS Foundation Collaboration Network provides support for collaboration in a particular area.
Support includes but not be limited to:
* a repo in the OpenJS org
* marketing support
* mailing lists
* slack channels
* representation on the CPC

The current Collaboration Networks spaces are listed in the main README.md in the CPC repository.

The [Collaboration Space Progression](./COLLABORATION_SPACE_PROGRESSION.md) document explains how a proposal for a new Collaboration space may be submitted and how Collaboration spaces move between stages.

## Authority Delegation

The Cross Project Council (CPC) may delegate scoped authority to a collaboration space. In such cases, the collaboration space may formally represent the Foundation, for example in a standards organization.

Collaboration Spaces to which the CPC delegates authority are listed below:

### Standards Collaboration Space

The purpose of the Standards Collaboration Space is to act as a facilitator for OpenJS Foundation projects to support their engagement in various Standards Organizations, Working Groups, Technical Committees, and other spaces where internationally recognized standards are collaborated upon.

Responsibilities include:

* approve and support OpenJS Foundation project contributors in attending meetings held by standards organizations
* make OpenJS Foundation project contributors aware of developments in relevant standards
* help OpenJS Foundation projects formulate a standards strategy
* support new contributors to standards-making activities
* mentor project contributors who are unfamiliar with standards-making processes
* make recommendations to the Cross Project Council regarding standards organization membership
* managing ongoing relationships with standards organizations
* ensuring that OpenJS representatives are aware of the responsibility of being a delegate of the foundation as outlined in [the membership expectations](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/blob/HEAD/MEMBER_EXPECTATIONS.md)
* facilitate when different projects' needs conflict
