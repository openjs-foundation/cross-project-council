All participants in the OpenJS Foundation projects and groups must follow the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). There are further expectations for
members of leadership teams including the
([CPC](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/CPC-CHARTER.md).

It is understood that members will have individual opinions and will express
their individual opinions during discussions within the organization. All
contributors are expected to be respectful of these different viewpoints,
and to work collaboratively with one another in a manner that constructively
elevates all contributors.

When decisions are made within the established guidelines and policies of the
OpenJS Foundation projects or groups, those in leadership roles have a
responsibility to uphold and respect the decision even if they disagree with
it. This is especially important in external communications, for example in
social media. Should the member be unwilling or unable to do so, then they
should resign their leadership position. This does not mean that decisions
cannot be revisited and discussed within the team at a later time.

Members of our leadership groups must also conduct themselves in a
professional and respectful manner. Some general guidelines include:

- Remediate quickly when you realize you made a mistake. Leaders are human,
  and they will make mistakes. However they should act swiftly to
  acknowledge mistakes and correct them.
- Aim to remediate first and then discuss. If other members of the
  team express concerns about actions, acknowledge their concerns by
  stopping the actions in question and then discuss within the team
  to come to a common agreement.
- Treat all community members with respect, consideration, and highest
  standards of ethical conduct.
- Value a diversity of views and opinions. Avoid preferential
  treatment, and hold everyone (including ourselves) accountable to the same
  set of standards. Everyone gets to speak up.
- Deal with issues directly with the person in question. Resist complaining
  about others in the OpenJS Foundation projects or team in a public sphere.
- Build trust by keeping your promises.
- Be the model of accountability and leadership. Provide the example of
  ownership and stewardship that everyone can follow to success.
- Commit to ongoing development and learning best practices for governing.
- Criticize ideas rather than people, discussing any concerns in person
  whenever possible, and taking responsibility for our statements.

While the guidelines above focus primarily on the spaces where
we participate in official OpenJS Foundation work (GitHub, IRC, meetings,
conferences), it is important to recognize that the public behavior
of members also reflects on the OpenJS Foundation projects and groups.

If it appears that any member of the leadership groups are acting outside
of the expectations set above please refer to our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
policy which outlines the process of making an official complaint.

This policy, and changes to it, are not retroactive.
