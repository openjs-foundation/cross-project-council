The OpenJS Foundation provides a set of monetary funds for projects of the OpenJS Foundation.

initiatives and give visibility/recognition to the champions of these project-specific initiatives, highligthing the individuals behind them.

## F.A.Q.

#### How might a project request for funds?

Funds should be requested on an ad-hoc basis through a PR requesting the funds. The requests do not need to follow a specific template,
but the description should contain relevant information regarding the project initiative, 
and any information that might be useful to highlight the need of funds and their benefits.

#### How these requests get evaluated?

The requests should go through the OpenJS Foundation CPC (Cross Project Council) and must have approval from the CPC members. 
Finally the request should be forwarded to the Board of Directors for final approval.

#### How much might a project request?

Dollar amounts will be determined on ad-hoc basis (proposed cap isn't necessary). Requests should be reasonable and can be discussed.
