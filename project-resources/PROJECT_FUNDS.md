# OpenJS Foundation Project-specific Initiative Funds

The OpenJS Foundation (OpenJSF) provides a set of monetary funds for projects of the OpenJSF. 
These funds are designed to support collaboration and incentive project-specific initiatives that have high-impact within the individual project's scope.

Alongside these lines, the fund exists to support the development of the project when the volunteer-based approach is not enough to support the community, e.g. infrastructure, tools, or security.

## F.A.Q.

### How might a project request funds?

Funds should be requested on an ad-hoc basis through a PR requesting the funds. The requests should follow a specific template,
but the description should contain relevant information regarding the project initiative, 
and any information that might be useful to highlight the need of funds and their benefits.

#### Fund Request PR Template

```md

### How these requests get evaluated?

The request must be made to the CPC for evaluation. The CPC evaluates the request following its [decision-making process](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/main/CPC-CHARTER.md#section-9-decision-making) and makes a recommendation to the Board.
Finally the request should be forwarded to the Board of Directors for final approval.

### How much might a project request?

The level of funding level will be determined on case by case basis after consideration of the request and discussion with the project maintainers.
