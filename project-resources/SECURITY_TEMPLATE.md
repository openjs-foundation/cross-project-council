# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately**:

- Email: xxxx@xxx (or another private alias monitored by maintainers)
- Or use GitHubâ€™s **Report a vulnerability** form on this repository (Security tab).

**Do not** file public GitHub issues for security problems.

When reporting, please include:
- Affected project/repo and version(s)
- Impact and component(s) involved
- Reproduction steps or PoC (if available)
- Your contact and preferred credit name

If you do not receive an acknowledgement within **6 business days**, or cannot find a private contact, you may **escalate to the OpenJS Foundation CNA** at `security@lists.openjsf.org`. If a project does not respond within **14 days**, escalation is appropriate.

## Coordination & Disclosure

We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure:
- We will acknowledge your report, assess impact, and work on a fix.
- We aim to provide status updates at reasonable intervals until resolution.
- We will publish a security advisory (and **CVE via the OpenJS CNA when applicable**) once a fix or mitigation is available. We credit reporters by default unless you request otherwise.
