## Requirements

* Candidates must be an active participant of one of the projects of the OpenJS Foundation.
  * An active member of a project community is someone who has had recent, sustained contributions to the project during the past 90 days.
* All projects in the foundation, regardless of stage or incubation status, are eligible to use the travel fund, this includes employees of the foundation member companies as well.
* The fund can cover the costs, in whole or in part, of a contributor's hotel, airfare, and event registration (for OpenJS World and the Collab Summit)
* Fund Applicants should seek to use employer funds as a first resort. Need is a factor.

## Process

Requests must be made prior to the start of travel. Requests submitted once travel is
complete will not be approved.

It is strongly recommended that you submit your request far enough in advance to get
approval before making relevant expenditures. Review of requests will take at least 72
hours and may take considerably longer. Note, with limited funds available, approval
is not guaranteed. If a request is rejected, reimbursement will not be issued. The
Foundation cannot pre-pay for travel expenditures.

## Visa Tips

For all events, 3rd party or hosted Foundation events, it is recommended to apply for
a visa at least 6 months prior to an event.

### For Industry Events

If you need a visa for the country in which the OpenJS Foundation event you are
attending is being held, [see the document on preparing for a visa application](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/TRAVEL_FUND/travel-visas.md).

### What The Foundation Can Do To Help:

The Foundation [provides guidance on preparing your visa application](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/TRAVEL_FUND/travel-visas.md),
including information on visa processing times and a checklist of items that a
visa application could require.

For Foundation-hosted events, the OpenJS Foundation provides a visa letter by The
Linux Foundation (does not guarantee visa approval). You can find the Visa Request
page under `Attend > Visa Request`.

### What the Foundation Cannot Do:

Please note that unless the Foundation is specifically hosting the event, we cannot
help with visa letters. The Foundation is also not able to contact consulates. When
the Foundation has done this in the past, our efforts have been unsuccessful and/or
weâ€™ve lacked the expertise to be effective.

For additional information on preparing your visa application or requesting a visa
letter, please email [visainfo@openjsf.org](mailto:visainfo@openjsf.org).

## Requesting Travel Funds

* Open a pull request that adds an entry to the appropriate year's file
  * Include as many fields as possible:
    * The name of the event you plan to attend.
    * The location, dates of the event and where you will be traveling from.
    * The presentation you intend to give, if applicable.
    * The size of the stipend you wish to receive.
      * In the pull request description, explain how you calculated your
        stipend. For example, include estimates for airfare, hotel, other
        transportation, and so on. The total amount should be your stipend
        request.
      * In the PR description, mention @openjs-foundation/cpc.
    * Once the final amount spent is known, update the table again with
      that information.
    * Certain details of your request (such as the column for date sent to
      finance) may be unknown initially; these can be filled in and updated
      during the process of reconciliation.

## Approval

A request is approved when all of the following criteria are met:

* The pull request has been open for at least 72 hours.
* The request has approval from at least four members of @openjs-foundation/cpc.
* No members of @openjs-foundation/cpc have objected to the request.
* The pull request has been merged. Any member may merge once other prerequisites have
  been met.

If a request is blocked by an objection from a member of @openjs-foundation/cpc, then the
only way for the request to be approved is for that committee to decide to approve the
request using whatever decision-making process the committee uses when consensus is not
reached.

As examples, the purpose of prior sponsored travels includes attending TC39 meetings,
attending [OpenJS collaboration summits](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/summit),
and mentoring [Code and Learn](https://github.com/nodejs/code-and-learn).

## Event/Project specific requests

While members from any OpenJS project can request approval for travel through
the process outlined in the `Approval` section, there may be situations in which 
a project wishes to manage the approvals an event or purpose instead of
leveraging this process.

A project may request an allocation from the travel fund as follows:

* Open a PR in the
  [cross-project-council](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council)
  repo with the following info:
  * Name of event or purpose for allocation
  * Who will be approvers for request (for example Node.js TSC and CommComm)
  * Repo/process through which approvals will be made. This process should capture
    at least the information in the "Requesting Travel Funds" section
  * Time period for which the allocation will be in use
  * Brief description
* The CPC will review and approve if appropriate
* At the completion of the event/allocation period or when re-imbursement
  is to be paid out the project will PR in the approvals into the
  appropriate year's file. This PR will be approved and landed by CPC
  members. Due to the pre-approval of the request from the project
  the only validation should be against the total that had been
  previouly approved by the CPC.

### Considerations for approval of a request

#### Impact

* Preference is given to events hosted or sponsored by the OpenJS Foundation. For example,
  OpenJS Collaboration summits and Diagnostics summits should be given precedence because
  they bring together members of the Foundation to help the Foundation projects advance.
* Preference is given to speakers and panelists of a conference. Speaking and doing panels
  at a conference generates a more significant impact than attending. However, individuals
  applying for the travel fund to speak or participate in panels should confirm that the
  event organizers cannot cover the travel expenses before submitting a request.

#### Outreach

* Preference is given to underserved communities. More specifically, within a subject the
  foundation is trying to promote awareness about (e.g. general knowledge about the Foundation)
  there are people, communities, and geographies where that knowledge is not very widespread.
  This is where preference will be given. For instance, an event in San Francisco would be
  less attractive than an event of the same size in Kansas City.

#### Cost

* The larger the stipend the more critically the travel fund admins will consider the request
  and application. The budget for this program is a finite resource.

#### Equity

* Preference is given to individuals who cannot receive travel funding from their employers
  or individuals who have not previously received a stipend.

## Reimbursement

Please send an email over to [operations@openjsf.org](mailto:operations@openjsf.org) or reach out to Foundation staff on the OpenJS Foundation Slack.

### Important:

* Expense reports must be submitted within 30 days of event date. Any reports submitted
  after 30 days may not be reimbursed.
* Disbursements are generally processed within 30 days.
* We are unable to pre-pay for expenses.
* The Cross Project Council representative to the Board of Directors will report back
  amounts consumed from the travel allocation on a monthly basis to the Board.

## 2018 Node.js Foundation Board of Directors Allocation

joint travel fund was approved in the amount of $60,000. The $60,000 was fully utilized in 2018.

## 2019 Node.js Foundation Board of Directors Allocation

The request from the Node.js [Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) and

The request from the
[Cross Project council](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council)

item in the budget was also renamed `community fund` as the expectation is that
CPC will propose additional ways to spend this fund beyond just travel.
