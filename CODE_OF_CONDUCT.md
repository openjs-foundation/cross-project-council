The OpenJS Foundation and its member projects use the Contributor
Covenant v1.4.1 as its Code of Conduct. Refer to the following
for the full text:

* [english](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct)
* [translations](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/translations)

Refer to the section on reporting and escalation in this document for the specific emails that can be used to report and escalate issues.

# Reporting

## Project Spaces

For reporting issues in spaces related to a member project please use the email provided by the project for reporting. Projects handle CoC issues related to the spaces that they maintain.  Projects maintainers commit to:

* maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident
* to participate in the path for escalation as outlined in
  the section on Escalation when required.

## Foundation Spaces
For reporting issues in spaces managed by the OpenJS Foundation, for example, repositories within the OpenJS organization, use the email `report@lists.openjsf.org`. The Cross Project Council (CPC) is responsible for managing these reports and commits to:

* maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident
* to participate in the path for escalation as outlined in
  the section on Escalation when required.

# Escalation

The OpenJS Foundation maintains a Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP). This is a foundation-wide team established to manage escalation when a reporter believes that a report to a member project or the CPC has not been properly handled. In order to escalate to the CoCP send an email to `"coc-escalation@lists.openjsf.org`.
