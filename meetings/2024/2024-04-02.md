   * Michael - does the issue make clear that there is an ask for consensus from the CPC? 
   * Tobie - we run into the issue of consensus often since this is an issue not a PR. 
   * Michael - suggests if a decision is in an issue explicitly call out asking for consensus with a deadline
   * Joe - we have an existing process for proposals, should this process be applied here?
   * Tobie - since there is an email thread that is already open, can we formalize confirming consensus via email. Can we have a FAQ, there have been some detailed questions asked about this? W3C asks for folks who dissent to show up, and to use +1s.
