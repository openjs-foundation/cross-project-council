### Regular reviews

Please review regularly our list of dates and reminders, our quarterly review issues, and check the list of issues that can be closed:

- https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/main/Dates-and-Reminders.md 
- https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/labels/cpc-quartely-review
- https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/labels/cpc-can-issue-be-closed

* For, Dates and Reminders, Ben felt that a twice yearly elections cycle may be cleaner / easier to manage, and is happy to look into a proposal for consideration. 

* Simplification of at large and regular member community roles was discussed and that topic will be folded into the above discussion. 
Robin stated impact roles/reps will remain the same and CPC and Community may be clarified (trying to keep representation and voting fair) but the different role names have sometimes caused confusion.
