### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* Revisiting our policy to become a CPC member 
[#1300](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1300)
Discussed during CPC call - how is access conflated with membership, and separating access from membership. Goal - propose we don’t have high barriers to becoming a CPC regular member, but that we ensure any additional access is always vetted. Refer to discussion/comments in the issue.
Pruning inactive members is valuable
Should we continue to block new applications for CPC regular membership? Explore this further in a working session? Joining the CPC does not automatically grant access, other than permission to attend private sessions. Does this mean having access to the private list?
Being inclusive is important and valuable - avoid over-steering to avoid potential risks that are always part of standard operations
