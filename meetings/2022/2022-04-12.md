### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* CPC Board Seat: Election Information and Call for Nominations [#859](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/859)
  * Call for nominations are open until April 15th.
  * Defer discussion on term limits/length until after the current election

* A focus on JavaScript security at OpenJS [#826](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/826)
  * Nothing new this week

* License check support/tooling [#815](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/815)
  * Linux foundation IT are working on it, have wire frames in progress
  * Hope to post more formal update to to the issue by end of day today

* Clarify requirements around CoC violation [#786](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/786)
  * No update this week
  * Robin spent some time looking at this, believe we have all of the pieces,
    just need to pull it together

* Update Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct to v2.1 [#851](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/851)
  * This has identified that we should have a good definition of the community
    * this is import as temporary and permanent bans are related to All of openjs or
      a specific project. So far itâ€™s been limited to a specific project community
      versus the overall OpenJS foundation based on discussion with projects.
    * Jordan, his understanding is a list possible options, so being vague, broader
      is ok.
    * Mike Samuel, when would it make sense to ban from smaller slice of
      OpenJS versus all?
    * Robin echo that keeping vague is good, if you feel strongly about something
      please take back to contributor covenant as best if changes are made there.
    * Tobie, not personal feeling, but remember discussion in Montreal, strong
       expression that some projects are not bought into being to told to ban people.
       * Have listed different options, but must be explicit about what we have buy
         in for.
    * Eemeli, change to 2.1 may have surprising change unless we properly
       define community. (same issue as Tobie mentioned)
