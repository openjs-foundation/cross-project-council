  * Michael added to agenda as it indicates that CPC is responsible for reports for projects that
    don’t have their own reporting process.
  * Tobie, if there is an issue reporting will likely come to CPC anyway. 
  * Next steps
    * PR into charter (add to the existing PR)
    * Outreach (Robin volunteered) to clarify what will happen if they don’t opt-in and inventory
      what processes each project already has in place
      * should only go to those who have not opted in
    * Write down additional requirements for CoC process that would apply to projects (Tobie will
      open a new issue to discuss that: [#786](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/786))
   
* Clarify whether it is a requirement to use either CLA or DCO at OpenJS Foundation [#778](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/778)
  * Remaining question is if we should update the IP policy to clarify you have to
    use one or the other?
  * comment with approach which is: The final discussion was that we'll keep this open. If/when there is some other update to the IP policy then we'll bring up clarifying this point. In the mean time, the guidance doc is pretty clear: https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/governance/IP_POLICY_GUIDANCE.md#4-adopting-the-dco-or-a-cla

* CPC Chairperson election 2021 [#772](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/772)
