* Jory provided a recap of the conversation from the working meeting last tuesday. The ask today is to the CPC to confirm the direction of this work so we can expand on more details. Sara asked whether we had put bounds around the amount each of the programs might fund. The group agreed this would be good to calculate, noting that the travel fund in the past has only spent around $30k. The group discussed taking a more experimental approach to test where the spend is. 


## Next week's working session

Are there any initiatives or agenda items that we should use a working session to further progress on?
