### Board Meeting Updates
 
*Extracted from **cross-project-council-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **openjs-foundation org** prior to the meeting.

### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* Criteria to move to Emeritus [#713](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/713)
  * Eemeli, if there is active leadership, then â…” vote does not make sense, instead
    just consensus.
  * Jordan, one of the advantages of foundation would be succession, ie if
    current contributors want to be done, then if still makes sense to be active,
    Foundation/CPC could look for new collaborators.
  * Tobie, should be CPC checkpoint (does not care if its is a vote, 
    or something else)
  * Michael, agree there should be a checkpoint, consensus would be fine so
    in this case maybe we should change wording to be consensus versus
    a vote.
  * Eemeli as part of going emeritus, the foundation should be given admin
    access to github repos, npm repos etc.
  * Need an offboarding checklist
  * Actions
    * Updated language (Eemeli will file PR for this)
    * Create offboarding checklist (filed in [#715](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/715))

* Rename master branches [#711](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/711)
  * Michael renamed all of the branches
  * Remaining work is to go through each repo and remove any references in
    the contents.

* Creating a new Twitch channel for OpenJSF  [#710](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/710)
  * Michael, alternative to youtube.  Robin is this something that the Foundation is
    considering to track/build?
  * Concern is you need to build up community.
  * Robin to be successful, needs the community to drive content. Tierney do you
    think we should be investing?
  * Tierney, if we want to do it we need multiple people to commit to do content.
  * Eemeli asks about AMAs and such
  * Michael is looking at stats (We do see up to 600 views for AMAs and even some Node.js community meetings)
  

* Primary CPC Director Election [#707](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/707)
  * Congratulations to Sara who is our new director!

* Improving Diversity and Inclusion at the OpenJSF [#699](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/699)
  * Did working session last week
  * Sara and Tobie are going to start by surveying the CPC
  * Then figure out how to extend to every project.

* Google Summer of Code 2021 [#673](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/673)
  * Applications close on Feb 19, so kind of a last reminder to reach out to Brian
    if project is interested.

* Remove Growth Stage [#650](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/650)
  * Agreed to merge (done)
