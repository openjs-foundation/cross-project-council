## Agenda

Extracted from **bootstrap-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **openjs-foundation org** prior to the meeting.

### openjs-foundation/bootstrap

* [BW] Infrastructure: Mailing lists  (5 min) [#134](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/bootstrap/issues/134)
  * What do we want to create comms-wise, what do we specifically not want to create?
  * From: https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/conduct/FOUNDATION_CODE_OF_CONDUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md we’d need coc-escalation@xxx.org and report@xxxx.org
 
  * Discussion around if we should qualify cpc with ‘internal’ or ‘private’. Consensus
     seems to be private. Sarah in CNCF they use toc-private and toc-public.
  * Tracy we do want to avoid conversations that can be public being in email versus
     in github.
  * Sarah, cpc-private might just be voting members. Todd agrees.  Michael also
    good to start with more limited emails.  
  * Jory, JS foundation projects do get a weekly email.
  * Michael can we make it easy to add/modify/manage the email lists like we 
    do in the Node.js org.
  * Dave, projects should be managing their own lists, right?
    * Brian, correct.
  * Actions: all to comment on the issue with mailing list requests

* [MB] Review meeting times (5 min)
[#129](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/bootstrap/issues/129)
  * Thought we should revisit the time given that we have new members
  * Myles, use spreadsheet, doodle or what ?  
    * Michael liked the spreadsheet
    * Myles one challenge with spreadsheet is how to cover a number of days
    * Matteo, travel on Mondays often conflicts.
    * Jory, use spreadsheet and try for Tuesday/Wednesday.
  * No objections
  * Actions: create Spreadsheet and send it around for input

* [JB] add PROJECT.md file [#132] (5 min)
(https://github.com/openjs-foundation/bootstrap/pull/132)
  * Move express to TBD for now
  * No objections to merge
  * Actions: update doc & merge

* [MB/JB] Create process for new projects joining foundation [#130](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/bootstrap/issues/130)
  * Myles planning to put together PR with process. Just did not have
    time to get to it this week.
  * Main thing it how we can allow people from projects who are considering
    joining the Foundation to get involved in advance of actually joining the foundation.
  * One thing Myles was thinking about is what does it look like to object for a
    Project joining. Along the lines of how we nominate collaborators in Node.js, would
    be good to let them know if there are objections before they publicly announce that
    they would like to join. Once they get past that “intent to join” stage objections would
    need to be more around process than anything else.
  * Dave Methvin, originally the JS process was to open a Pull request but there were some
    challenges, most often projects contact privately and then they later make public
    Request.  Tierney agree that it makes sense.
  * Need some kind of mutual fitness criteria that the CPC voting members agree to before the
    application becomes public knowledge
  * Myles, maybe not quite that, if there were major objections going in we should know that.



* [MD/JB] Project Housekeeping: Create Checklist for New Projects / Updating Existing Projects [#121](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/bootstrap/issues/121)
  * Jory will do PR for next onboarding list.
  * Jory 

* [MD] Steps to bootstrap CPC and new Foundation [#115](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/bootstrap/issues/115)

 * Initial impact projects done
 * Landing CoC TBD - Michael Dawson to carry this week

 * Target initial meeting - May
 * Project checklist (#121) & identifying the representatives (hard deadline 1 month prior to May CPC meeting (May 1?) )
