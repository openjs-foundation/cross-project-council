### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* Clarify the license of the materials in this repo [#651](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/651)
  * No license in the repo right now?
  * Possibly MIT but unclear.
  * Can we relicense CC?
  * MIT is OK for documentation (see https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/governance/IP_POLICY_GUIDANCE.md#1-licensing
  * Thereâ€™s a license in the repo, so we are all set. Closing. 

* Should we have a lightweight mechanism to spin off ad hoc CPC working groups? [#649](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/649)
  * Suggestion to open an issue on the CPC for an ad-hoc meeting.
  * What about creating a dedicated Issue template? Lots of +1.
  * Broaden access to the calendar?
  * Broaden access to the zoom account? Easier to just use the same zoom link as the CPC meeting.
