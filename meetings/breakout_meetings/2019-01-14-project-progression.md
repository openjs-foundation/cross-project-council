## Action Items as a result of this meeting:

- Open Issue to work on definition of Open Governance for Top Level Projects [done]
- Open Issue to clarify intentions around code of conduct, enforcement and monitoring [done]

## Agenda:

Today we will have open, timeboxed discussion of the following concerns identified during stage 0/1. These have been roughly ordered by descending level of difficulty

### 25 mins - Whether there is an Open Governance requirement for Top Level Projects (Matteo)

* Matteo: One of the core tenants of Node is Open Governance. People can join, there is a growth path, etc. This is a good working model for Node. The governance is transparent. Some projects follow BDFL or the governance is not transparent. BDFL may not be compatible for the CPC discussions. This is more or less my point and why I think having 
* Chris: Do current top level projects have this model? Looking at JSF projects, how many have resources to send to CPC voting members.
* Jory: There not top level projects, they’re graduated. They’re not as big as node, but tend to have participation in more concentrated orgs. They have indicators that they are mature functioning projects that take care of their community.Does the path, governance and CoC have to be a requirement? 
* Matteo: It’s a requirement. You should have more than one company contributing to it. My view at least for the best success of the project.
* Adam: There’s not stability if there’s only one company contributing
* Bryan: In the cloud native computing foundation, there are only contribution requirements for committers. That particular bar is not that high because it’s only looking at diversity of contributors.
* Matteo: An important part is: diversity of contributors (full members of the project). Is the project run by a single entity? Yes: that doesn’t set a good example for the top level. 
* Tierney: Most healthy ecosystems in our ecosystem are run by a single entity.
* Myles: They’re open source by OSI standards. Let’s not conflate this with open governance.
* Tierney: Let’s build definition around shared values that we’re working towards.
* Jory: At JSI we strongly support open governance. Many of these projects have been around a lot longer than node. We should bring these learnings to the table.
* Myles: When were talking about the cross council of the CPC, it’s very open to everyone. Fundamentally: any project that’s coming to the foundation is going to be able to participate in the consensus seeking process. Voting would be limited to the top level process. The majority of projects that are coming in will be empowered to be a top level project if they want to engage in that process.
* Myles: What does ‘at large’ mean?
* Jory: Grandfathered projects that didn’t have to go through a process to be recognized as top level projects.
* Myles: are the projects in the jsf expecting to be grandfathered in?
* Jory: It’s a mixed bag: eg. require.js is happy to move into emeritus status, some projects expect to go there. There are some projects that have been involved and want a seat at the table. Dojo is the greatest example, JQuery would like access as well, but how is still a bit undefined.
* Dave: I don’t think in the JSF one of the reasons why the projects have graduated is that they weren’t comfortable with the level of participation they had. If a project wants to participate in a higher level process, they have to put some participation in. 
* Myles: One of the things that we want is an engaged an successful CPC. We need to identify the projects that want to be involved an participate. What are the shared bits that make these the same, and identify the bits that make them successful. Who’re the stakeholders who will show up on day one and what does it look like to receive help from those people?
* Jory: I agree we’re looking for engaged cross-project engagement. To me that doesn’t look like a project doesn’t have to be super involved to help or be active – especially if they don’t meet some definition that we’ve defined here.
* Myles: The only difference for top level projects is that they’d be the voting members if something went to a vote.
* Dave: We need definition on what makes a top level member, and the steps to become that.
* Jory: We have to define what open governance means.
* Dave: React - although they accept PRs, are all the members who work on it FB employees? If so that’s not open governance. If the requirements are that the committers are employees or contractors of one org, it’s not open.
* Tierney: There’s a project that isn’t open, and wants to move into an open foundation - if we have guide rails for them they shouldn’t be blocked. If it was react, they should be able to move into a ‘react org’, and adopt an open governance if they wanted to. That’s a success path.
* Myles: We’re talking about becoming a top level project.
* Michael: Could you join as a BDFL and join, and stay that way?
* Myles: From the legal standpoint there will be clear guidelines for participation as you graduate to different levels. We have a vision of what a sustainable open governance model looks like, and if you want to join through our process, we can guide you through that process.
* Dave: When you get to legal issues it gets a bit trickier, but if you look at the JSF lists for example - we do have a membership process. The period of time that you’re not a voting member could be very short if you want to be active and be a member of CPC. You can follow a best practice to get there.
* Jory: My Concerns for these definitions is that you might be precluding these smaller projects from having a voice and being able to take on voting decisions.
* Matteo: For me it seems a little bit complicated. If a project isn’t very active, would they be willing to invest time in building the foundation?
* Jory: There’s a difference between thriving and small projects. There are upper limits to projects, though they are thriving, and that’s ok.
* Michael: We’re trying to word it so anyone can participate in the regular work. There are multiple open paths to becoming voting members, if the project is big enough there is direct representation. If the project is smaller there are several paths to get there in the governance being proposed.
* Jory: We believe in the power of small projects/business and what they can bring to the table. We don’t want to undervalue that.
* Tierney: I concur 100%. That’s how node was built.
* Myles: not hearing anything that’s saying small projects can’t become voting members/contributors right now as a top level project.
* Jory: If a project needs to have an open governance and we don’t really know what an open governance is, we’re stuck. We need a definitions of what that means here in this meeting.
* Myles: We can extrapolate features from our existing projects on what that means.
* Jory: I’ve talk with projects about where they want to be with us, I don’t think there will be too many hang ups. It just comes down to being top level voting members.
* Jory: Projects who’ve expressed interest in becoming top level: Web Hint, Dojo, JerryScript, WebDriver, Mocha.
* Dave: Having true open governance requires enough people regularly participating, and enough diversity in the contribution base, etc. We need mentorship to exist.
* Matteo: I can stand behind the JSF’s mentorship values 100%.

### 15 mins - Defined Project Proposal Requirements, & explicit metrics for how to validate that those requirements have been met. (Chris H., Matteo, Jory)

- do we require projects to keep public lists of orgs using their technology?


### 10 mins - Clarification of Stage Definitions and Monikers (see also #44)

*Note: we did not have time to cover this*

### 5 mins - Confirmation that the CPC will be responsible for project acceptance process

* Jory: This is the info we request to process the application into the foundation. Do we want to truncate this list a great deal, or accept it for evaluation?
* Myles: Adoption is one we may want to consider. Community Guidelines: evaluating the culture of our foundation. Does the project have a CoC, and moderation guidelines? Are people willing to adopt them and think that’s reasonable in order to join the foundation?
* Tierney: There has to be a minimum CoC.
* Chris: All JSF have accepted the JSF CoC.
* Jory: That’s true, but all JSF projects have the option to adopt their own, although none have exercised that option.
* Dave: At the JSF there is a conduct committee, when you’re trying to deal with conduct issues it helps to have 3rd parties help with that process. There certainly should be a CoC called out, they don’t have to use the foundation’s one, but their CoC should be approved before we’ve accepted them. We seen committers decide not to take action against someone because of their ‘committer’ status, that’s not a good pattern to follow.
* Chris: if somebody wants to bring in their own CoC, maybe it makes sense to enforce values upon their project.
* Dave: There aren’t a lot of places where it’s appropriate to centralize things, but this seems like one to me since it’s difficult to address this without that model.
* Manil: If we’re expecting projects to have a CoC, they may not have the experience in building/doing this. We should give them training, and can only join if they do that. They should handle it well if they go through our training.
* Dave: I agree - people who’re great at dealing with conflict resolution are best suited for this (more than folks who mostly write code). Training would help.
* Michael: If nothing goes right, having an independent 3rd party to help with this seems right to me.

### 5 mins - Clarification on what resources a Archived/Emeritus project will have/need

*Note: we did not have time to cover this*

### (time permitting) Language for the Proposed Annual Review Process - see CNCF process documentation
