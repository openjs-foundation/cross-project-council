### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* Is a project OK to use CC CoC 2.1 before OpenJS Foundation does? [#1029](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1029)
  * in theory, this should be fine

* Enabling Payments for GitHub Codespaces for Projects [#1009](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1009)
Looking good on webpack, need to ensure its billed to the right LF code (for accounting) and we need a better solution for the billing account, right now tied to Benâ€™s email, should be one that more than one person can access

* Create some documentation / web page to describe the collaboration model of OpenJS projects [#1003](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1003)
  * Matteo and Robin will work on this; thinking about sessions too

* Add patching script for CoC modifications [#910](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/910)
  * We seem to have approval on the pull request for the patching script
  * Yagiz and Joe will work on next steps

* Update Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct to v2.1 [#851](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/851)
  * dependent on 910

* Licence check support/tooling [#815](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/815)
  * This could be good to have this for two fold:
      - have the foundation run this on projects repos/org for licenses and coc and other requirements
      - directions for projects (in project-resources directory) to run it themselves in their org to test regularly; as Michael Dawson said: Node.js creates repos regularly; would be good to run regularly to be sure licenses are present and acceptable

* Clarify requirements around CoC violation [#786](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/786)
  * we will go through checklist in this issue after patching script is landed above

* Share board deck from March Meeting (PRIVATE SESSION) [#1031](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1031)

### openjs-foundation/standards

* Secure the Web Forward Workshop - Call for Papers [#213](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/213)
  * Jory and Robin are on program committee; June 7, 8 in London
  * April 24 CFP deadline
