    * Add somewhere “if you are not comfortable with public application” email here
    * Will be added to the public table after the fact.
  * Matteo, reasonable step but believes info should not be internet public at any point. Only available to project members of the foundation.
  * LJHarb, maybe only public to regular members?
  * Sara - who should the emails go to?
  * Joe - Ben at foundation, Matteo - should likely go to CPC
