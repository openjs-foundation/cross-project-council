* Ask for additional Travel Budget [#1178](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1178)
  * A question was raised to understand the board’s response to the request for additional travel budget. This was discussed at the board meeting in October (at the LF Members Summit) and the board declined to provide additional travel budget for this year. However, if there are individuals who have immediate needs there was a request to elevate those requests for case-by-case consideration. 
  * The board would like more clarity on the goals for the travel budget and the process for granting awards from that budget before allocating additional funds.
