### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* Code of Conduct Plan of Action [#1122](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1122)
  * Great plan. Let's do it. Help out if you can.

* Standardize on Collab Spaces over Working Groups [#1110](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1110)
  * Michael - Working group inherited from original node project. Collab Space, in my mind more open, giving folks space and resources to allow for collaboration. Do we think the formal delegation to a working group of responsibility is something we want to maintain.
  * Tobie - the only distinction in the docs appears to be delegation of decision making. People get confused, we might as well simplify.
  * LF PM can assist with migration tasks in Github

* Non-violent communication / strategic workplace conflict resolution training? [#1106](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1106)
