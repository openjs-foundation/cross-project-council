### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* Node.js TSC Charter change [#1028](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1028) [#1350](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/1350)

* Enabling Payments for GitHub Codespaces for Projects [#1009](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1009)
  * Sean: will investigate infra and go from there; likely use Webpack as pilot

* Create some documentation / web page to describe the collaboration model of OpenJS projects [#1003](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1003)
  * There may be an LF Foundation starting up around open governance
  * Folks volunteered to start a collaborative doc: Matteo, Joe, Robin
  * Matteo is a part of a panel at OSSNA
  * Sean: We could start with a simple list: 
    * Name, attributes of the model, example project in the wild, tradeoffs of the model
  * Darcy: There was some work done in this space in the Node.js Package Maintenance WG awhile back - a “Supports” spec fell out of that conversation (ref. https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/blob/main/docs/PACKAGE-SUPPORT.md)
    * Can imagine adding a key in this existing spec for the “governance” model once the names/attributes are known/defined

* Add patching script for CoC modifications [#910](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/910)
  * Minor technical issue should be easily resolved and then sorted

* Update Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct to v2.1 [#851](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/851)
  * This will be closed pending other CoC process changes above

* Licence check support/tooling [#815](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/815)
  * Will make LF IT aware
  * Will discuss with Michael Dawson (OP)

* Clarify requirements around CoC violation [#786](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/786)
  * Will review once other CoC work is complete

* Any projects for Grace Hopper Open Source Day
  * Open Source Day background and CFP can be found here (for later discussion) https://ghc.anitab.org/programs-and-awards/open-source-day/
  * CFP is open now
  * Let’s create a list of various repos to create issues for these sorts of things (not unlike what Claudio did recently for COllab Summit)
  * Paula to follow up with Claudio for example and post issues to the OpenJSF repos referencing the topic and the CFP


* [Open Source Summit Europe (Bilbao) - 19th-21st September](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe)
  * Don’t miss the deadline! CFP is open, now is the time to apply for this event
  * Start percolating the idea of Collab Summit for EU soon
  * Still need to figure out if the Collab Summit will happen the day before or the day after
  * OpenJS World CFP is open as well until May 2

* CPC Primary Director Election
  * 2 weeks open for nominations
  * 1 week for voting
