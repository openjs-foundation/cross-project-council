### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* \[vis.gl\] Project Charter Approval [#1656](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1656)
    * It was agreed that Ben would ask the project to revert their merge so that the CPC would be able to comment. Additionally we would ask for a clearer description of the TSC composition (for example min/max size, how folks are elected).
* 2025 OpenJS Foundation CPC Selections: Impact, At-Large, and Regular [#1655](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1655)
    * Impact project should not go through the form. The issue and form will be fixed to address this.
* Create a Bundler (Tooling) Collaboration Space [#1630](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1630)
    * General agreement that this is a good idea, decision to move forward and to include deliverables/outcomes in the proposal.
* Summit: Webpack Collaboration Summit [#1608](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1608)
    * Not addressed today as Claudio had dropped from the call.
* clarifying charter requirements [#1607](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1607)
    * Issue #1656 discussed earlier is a great example why we need more clarity around what should be in project charters.
    * General agreement that we don't want to formalize this by creating a policy. Instead, we want to lead by example by improving the charter template through better defaults and clearer instructions.
    * Next steps would be a pull request that clarifies in the PROJECT_PROGRESSION file that the template is the source of truth for what belongs in the charter, and adds better defaults an guidance to the charter.
    * This seems a good topic to move forward in the next working session.
    * We also briefly discussed whether projects that had too much in the charter could remove sections that were requested without CPC approval. The CPC decided against this; if you're making changes to the charter, you need to run those changes to the CPC, unless those are strictly editorial.
* Update website to match stage name changes [#1604](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1604)
    * Wait on outcome of [#1654](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/1654)
* Rename "Complete" project stage to "Feature-complete", add new "Sunsetting" stage [#1654](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1654)
  * This was presented as a way to make it easier for maintainers to be transparent about their intentions wrt to the maturity of their project.
  * In particular, this changes allows projects that are feature complete, but don't have an intention to sunset to say so, without suggesting that they are on a track for archiving their projects.
* JavaScriptLandia Award Nominations [#1601](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1601)
    * Closed. Decisions announced at JS Conf (Oct. 16).
* Audit github org owners [#1591](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1591)
* Move Dojo to at-large status [#1589](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1589)
    * Pending [1654](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/1654).
* Clarify what information is collected about individuals as part of CoC incident handling [#1528](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1528)
* Project Website Footers [#1525](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1525)
* Possible GDPR Conflict Summary for Code of Conduct Report Privacy [#1522](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1522)
