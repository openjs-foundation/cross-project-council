### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* What version of the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct should we use? [#1457](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1457)
   * RG â†’ reviewed policies and suggest we wait until 3 is released and adopt that version, unsure of the timeline. TL â†’ agrees that we should wait on 3, there is not a large difference between 2 and 2.1. TL â†’ any objections to waiting on 3.0 to adopt? MD â†’ would not block on doing a deep dive on the differences, we should continue to adopt updates to the covenant. There was consensus on adoption 3.0 and no voiced objections. 

* Election: 2025 CPC Directors [#1451](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1451)
  * CPC elections are happening!  

* Proposal To Add A SERVICES.md or similar documentation to OpenJS Projects [#1425](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1425)
   * MD â†’ Can we ask the security working group for a recommendation
   * ML â†’ Electron would not want their list to be made public, we do have this documented internally and sharing this with OpenJS might be an option
   * Ben â†’ will bring this up in the next security working group
   * TL â†’ managing this in a non github way across projects is a challenge, can we do this in a lightweight way that accomplishes the goal but does not have the security concerns. To ML, what level of information would you be comfortable sharing? ML â†’ electron would be ok sharing the private list.  

* Code of Conduct Plan of Action - Remaining Items [#1417](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1417)
  * Update provided to CPC. Work continues in the next working session.


* Changes in Node.js TSC charter [#1391](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1391)
   * Believe it just needs CPC approval
   * Issue had the wrong label ðŸ™‚
   * There were no objections to the change voiced in the call and it was therefore approved

* Health-check on the NativeScript TSC charter [#1387](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1387)
   * Ben will invite Nathan and Tobie into a meeting to discuss.

* Adding affiliation clause to NativeScript charter [#1386](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1386)
   * See above

* continuity policy and package registries? [#1355](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1355)

* Update onboarding and post-graduation checklists to match new CoC policy [#1255](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1255)
  * Update provided to CPC. Work continues in the next working session.
