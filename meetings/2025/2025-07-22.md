### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* \[Webpack\] Organization of a Webpack Hackathon [#1510](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1510)
  * asking for any followup; interesting idea that perhaps other projects, like Express, may be interested in

* Is AI-assisted development allowed? [#1509](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1509)
   * Discussed in the working session, next step is to clarify and draft specific questions for legal review.
      * for reference, ISO guidance
      * discussion at TC39
      * Clarify applicable contexts and if/how they might differ, e.g. when filing an issue, when contributing code
      * The junk pr situation, does this fall under SPAM? How should contributions be evaluated?
      * Guidance for AI powered tools (coderabbit). AI tools that might help evaluate PRs/properly maintaining open source projects. 
      * frame this as how to allow AI assisted development, rather than if it is allowed.
	* this is important for asking the lawyers but the latter should still be considered for the policy discussion
      * Question for legal, if it is determined that it is not allowed, what is their advice on policies and repercussions, e.g. what happens if this is not allowed, a PR is landed and we discover later that this was generated by AI.
     * Can we expect any answer other than “grey area don’t do it” from the lawyers? Should we just state that at this time we have no stance at this? Will this topic take up a bunch of time without getting to an answer. 

* Organize regular batched policy updates for foundation projects [#1486](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1486)
   * Covered in last working session. This would be great, but time intensive. Let’s continue moving forward on issues independent of figuring out batched updates so that progress is not blocked. 
   * Create an issue to work towards an end of year townhall/newsletter update (perhaps we can add in updates from projects, can a 2-way update increase participation)
   * Suggest working session topic and that we spend the working session on one topic

* \[cosmos.gl\] Project Charter Approval [#1484](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1484)
   * Approved. 

* Create third-party-services-documentation-policy.md [#1482](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/1482)
  * not discussed

* Resources: GitHub's DevConnect Program [#1472](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1472)
  * Feedback given to GH.
  * Intent was for this to be used more for meetups than collab summits.
  * Waiting for GH to get back to us.

* Code of Conduct Information sharing between a project and the foundation [#1470](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1470)
  * not addressed during the call

* Review NativeScript Charter for Approval [#1467](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1467)
   * Will discuss next time. 

* What version of the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct should we use? [#1457](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1457)
  * not discussed

* Proposal To Add A SERVICES.md or similar documentation to OpenJS Projects [#1425](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1425)
  * not discussed

* Code of Conduct Plan of Action - Remaining Items [#1417](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1417)
  * not discussed

* continuity policy and package registries? [#1355](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1355)
  * not discussed

* Update onboarding and post-graduation checklists to match new CoC policy [#1255](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1255)
  * not discussed
