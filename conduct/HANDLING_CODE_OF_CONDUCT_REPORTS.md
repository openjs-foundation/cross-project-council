# Handling reports and escalation
This document describes the proposed process for handling reports and escalation, along with relevant roles in the OpenJS Foundation.

This process covers two types of reports based on the [Foundation's Code of Conduct Requirements](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/conduct/FOUNDATION_CODE_OF_CONDUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md):

* Reports for spaces managed by the Cross Project Council (CPC) which come in through `report@opensjsf.org`
* Escalations which come in through `coc-escalation@openjsf.org`.

Generally, reports to coc-escalation should refer to a report that was already submitted to:

* report@openjsf.org or
* one of the project's reporting emails
* explanation of why the reporter does not feel comfortable using the previous reporting emails for the initial report

If a report to coc-esclation does not include one of those, the reporter will be asked to to provide one of those three as the
reason for reporting to coc-escalation.

All members of the [Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP)](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/FOUNDATION_CODE_OF_CONDUCT_REQUIREMENTS md#code-of-conduct-panel) are subscribed to the report@openjsf.org mailing list.
The current list of members is documented in ./CODE_OF_CONDUCT_PANEL_MEMERS.md.

## Code of Conduct

The OpenJS Foundation and its member projects use the Contributor Covenant v2.0 as its Code of Conduct. Refer to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the full text of the CoC and the reporting and escalation procedures.

## Confidentiality and record-keeping
Personal information is confidential. All reports should be recorded, together with the discussion of it. The following private repos will be used to record and discuss reports.

* report@openjsf.org -> github.com/openjs-foundation/moderation


For each report there should be an issue which captures the report, discussion and final conclusion. The report should NOT contain identifying details of the reporter.

## Conflict of Interest

Any member of the CPC or Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP) who is involved in the report should recuse themselves from the discussions.

## Reports to report@openjsf.org

Note: We understand that the reporter and the target can be separate persons. In this case the CPC will communicate with the reporter unless the target gives permission for the CPC to communicate with them.

When a report is received to `report@openjsf.org` the following actions will be taken:
   * An OpenJS Foundation staff representative will respond within 24 hours to the reporter or target confirming that the report has been received. 
   * The staff representative will seek to determine whether the report is emergent and requires immediate attention (e.g. for an ongoing issue) or the report is a reactive response to an incident with no immediate danger. 

   * The Staff Representative will identify two contact persons from its CoC Panel to examine and act on the report. The contact persons will be chosen on the basis of schedule and availability.
   * The contact persons will then execute the following procedures:
     1. Acknowledging the report: The contact persons will respond to let the reporter or target know that the report is being discussed.
     1. Information gathering: The contact persons will collect information in the private moderation repository..
     1. Discussing the report: The contact persons will discuss the facts of the report in context of opinions via meeting, email, or discussion via private issue.
     1. Acting on the report: The contact persons will attempt to reach consensus on the action to be taken.
     1. Sharing the resolution: If the contact persons are in agreement, the resolution is shared with the reporter or target by the contact persons and recorded in the moderation repository. If the contact persons are not in agreement or if the reporter or target expresses concern or dissatisfaction with the resolution,  then the contact persons will bring the report to the CoC Panel  for further discussion. This cycle can continue until the panel reaches consensus that the reporter or target's concerns have been adequately addressed. If the panel cannot reach consensus within 7 days, the matter will be taken to a vote of the panelists. If no feedback is received within 7 days the resolution is considered as accepted. 
     1. Final resolution: the resolution is implemented and the outcome reported to the reporter or target, and/or other involved parties.
