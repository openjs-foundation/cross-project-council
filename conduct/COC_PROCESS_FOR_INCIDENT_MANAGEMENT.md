This document defines how the OpenJS Foundation implements its code of conduct.

If you want to report an incident, go to [code-of-conduct.openjsf.org][CoC].

***

The CPC will be updating these processes shortly. Progress is tracked in [Issue #1256](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/1256).

In the meantime, the previous code of conduct incident management processes can be found [here](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/cf85fee1411de2c06632d83a9e4876fa8eeb0787/conduct/HANDLING_CODE_OF_CONDUCT_REPORTS.md).
