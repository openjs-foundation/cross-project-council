# Code of Conduct Patching Script

This document explains the knowledge behind the patching script used
to make any changes on the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file.

The patching script lives under
[pkgjs/patch-my-code-of-conduct][project-link] repository.
It is developed as a GitHub workflow to make it easier for projects
to adopt into their existing repositories.

## Goal

The goal of the patching script is to make Code of Conduct upgrade
and review process easier to maintain for open-source projects.
It removes any direct changes done to the original document, and
provides an easier to review and accept changes to the document
provided by the Contributor Covenant.

## GitHub Workflow configuration

The configuration file for the patching script lives inside
`.github/workflows/patch-code-of-conduct.yml` file. The configuration
file also includes an additional GitHub workflow to automatically
open a pull request in the event of a changed file after the
work of the patching scripts job is complete.

### Settings

- `base_url`: Base URL is the path to the preamble file (the file
  that is prepended to the Code of Conduct document).
- `template_url`: It is the URL to the Contributor Covenant website
  that includes the original unchanged document.
- `patch_file_path`: It is the path to the patching file.
- `output_file_path`: It is the path to the file where the changes
  should apply to. 

### Files

- `workflows/patch-code-of-conduct.yml`: This file contains
  the necessary configuration to setup the patching script.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT_PREAMBLE.md`: This file contains the text
  prepended to the original Code of Conduct file. It may contain
  project/organization specific information that may live outside
  of the definition of the original Code of Conduct versions.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT_PATCH.patch`: This file contains a patch
  generated by the contributors of the project to update **only**
  the texts defined in the Code of Conduct URL defined by the
  patching script.

## Workflows

### Make a change to `PREAMBLE.md` file

1. Open a pull-request updating either `CODE_OF_CONDUCT_PATCH.patch`
   or `CODE_OF_CONDUCT_PREAMBLE.md` file. The default procedures of
   merging a pull request will be followed as usual.
2. Upon successful merging the proposed changes to the main branch
   patching script will open a pull request with a target of `main`
   branch updating `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file with the proposed changes.
3. Since the approval for the original change is done in step 1, unless
   there is a bug with the CoC patching script this pull request opened
   by the bot from the workflow should land without issue.

### Make a change to `PATCH.patch` file

1. Copy the original file and rename it as `PREVIOUS_COC.md`
2. Update `PREVIOUS_COC.md` according to your needs.
3. Run the following command to generate the patching file:
   `diff -Naur PREVIOUS_COC.md CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md > conduct/artifacts/CODE_OF_CONDUCT_PATCH.patch`
4. Delete the temporary `PREVIOUS_COC.md` file.
5. Push your changes to a new branch and open a pull-request with a target
   of `main` branch.

**Testing**: You can run the following command to apply the changes of
your patching script to validate the output:

```
patch -i conduct/artifacts/CODE_OF_CONDUCT_PATCH.patch CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md --no-backup-if-mismatch
```

### Update Code of Conduct version

1. Update Github Workflow `template_url` attribute.
2. Regenerate your patching file by following the patch file workflow.

## Recommendations

1. In order to decrease the maintenance cost of the updating
   Code of Conduct, it is recommended to use the correct CoC version
   in the GitHub workflow configuration.
2. It is recommended to create a pull request for the changes made
   by the patching script to avoid committing changes. Remember that,
   this should be dealt with an extremely delecate process due to the
   probability of the concerns mentioned in recommendation 3.
3. The pull requests opened by the patching script bot should be approved
   without issue. Modifying the PR created from the workflow would put
   our code in an ambiguous state where the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file and
   the files that the script depend on do not match with each other.
   All changes should happen in the files outlined above and resulting PRs
   should remain unmodified.
