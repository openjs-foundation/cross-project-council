# Code of Conduct Team Charter

The Cross Project Council (CPC) delegates enforcement of the [Code of Conduct][CoC] to the Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team) through this Code of Conduct Team Charter. This charter defines the composition and roles of the CoC Team, along with CoC team responsibilities and operations.

## Responsibilities

[TODO: add links]

The CoC Team's responsibilities are to:

- Handle code of conduct [incident reports][incident report].
- Handle code of conduct [escalation requests][escalation].
- Handle code of conduct [appeals][appeal].
- Keep the CPC up to date of cases requiring the CPC's attention.
- Provide regular transparency reports to the CPC.
- Define, document, and maintain all processes necessary to its operations, notably the [CoC Process for Incident Management](COC_PROCESS_FOR_INCIDENT_MANAGEMENT.md).
- Work with OpenJS Foundation staff to develop infrastructure and processes necessary to comply to the requirements of the [code of conduct policy][CoC Policy], notably when it comes to record keeping, confidentiality, and transparency.
- Uphold this charter, the [code of conduct][CoC], and the [code of conduct policy][CoC Policy].

## CoC Team Structure

The CoC Team is composed of five (5) [primary members][#primary-members] and a variable number of [alternate community members][#alternate-community-members].

### Primary members

Primary members are CoC Team members responsible for [handling cases][#handling-cases].

The five primary members are:

* The OpenJS Foundation Executive Director
* The OpenJS Foundation Communications Manager
* Three (3) community members

The name and email address of the primary members are documented in the [code of conduct][primary members].

### Alternate community members

Alternate community members are CoC Team Members that are available as backup when there aren't enough primary community members available to [handle a case][#handling-cases].

### Member selection

The CPC will hold an annual selection process in order to select primary and alternate community members.

[TODO:
- candidates can self-nominate
- candidates can self-nominate for alternate or primary role
- candidate must meet eligibility requirements
- CPC must work towards creating a CoC Team that is diverse
- CPC member can block a candidate if they can motivate the reason why
]

### Eligibility

Primary and alternate community members of the CoC Team must: 

* Commit to uphold the Foundation's [Code of Conduct][CoC]
* Commit to uphold the Foundation's [Code of Conduct Policy][CoC Policy]
* Commit to uphold this charter
* Be willing to treat every accused individuals in the same way regardless of the impact of their contributions to open source

### Term

Members of the CoC Team serve a one year term. There are no limits on the number of terms a CoC Team member may serve.

### Chair

The primary members will select a chair from one of the three primary community members. When the chair isn't involved in a case, the members handling the case must chose a chair among themselves.

The chair is responsible for handling the case according to documented processes, and making sure that the CoC Team upholds this charter, the [code of conduct][CoC] and the [code of conduct policy][CoC Policy].

## Handling cases

Each appeal, escalation request, and incident report must be handled by a minimum of three (3) and a maximum of five (5) members.

At least two (2) of the members involved in handling a case must be community members and at least one (1) must be an OpenJS Foundation staff member.

If not enough primary community members are available to meet those requirements, primary members should involve one or more alternate community members. Similarily, if no OpenJSF staff primary member is available, another OpenJSF staff representative, choosen by the staff, should be involved instead.

Appeals to responses provided by the CoC Team itself should be handled by a different set of members than those responsible for the initial response.

## Decision making process

The CoC Team uses the Cross Project Council's [Decison Making Process][decision-making].
