# Code of Conduct Team Charter

The Cross Project Council (CPC) delegates enforcement of the [Code of Conduct][CoC] to the Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team) through this Code of Conduct Team Charter. This charter defines the composition and roles of the CoC Team, along with CoC team responsibilities and operations.

## Responsibilities

[TODO: add links]

The CoC Team's responsibilities are to:

- Handle code of conduct incident reports.
- Handle code of conduct escalation requests.
- Handle code of conduct appeals.
- Keep the CPC up to date of cases requiring the CPC's attention.
- Provide regular transparency reports to the CPC.
- Define, document, and maintain all processes necessary to its operations, notably the [CoC Process for Incident Management](COC_PROCESS_FOR_INCIDENT_MANAGEMENT.md).
- Work with OpenJS Foundation staff to develop infrastructure and processes necessary to comply to the requirements of the [code of conduct policy][CoC Policy], notably when it comes to record keeping, confidentiality, and transparency.
- Uphold this charter, the [code of conduct][CoC], and the [code of conduct policy][CoC Policy].

## CoC Team Structure

The CoC Team is composed of five (5) primary members and a variable number of alternate community members.

### Primary members

The five primary members are:

* The OpenJS Foundation Executive Director
* The OpenJS Foundation Communications Manager
* Three (3) community members

### Chair

The primary members will select a chair from one of the three primary community members. When the chair isn't involved in a case, the members handling the case must chose a chair among themselves.

The Chair is responsible for handling the case according to documented processes, and making sure that the CoC Team upholds the Code of Conduct and the Code of Conduct Policy.

## Handling cases

Each appeal, escalation request, and incident report must be handled by a minimum of three (3) and a maximum of five (5) members.

At least two (2) of the members involved in handling a case must be community members and at least one (1) must be an OpenJS Foundation staff member.

If not enough primary community members are available to meet those requirements, primary members should involve one or more alternate community members. Similarily, if no OpenJSF staff primary member is available, another OpenJSF staff representative, choosen by the staff, should be involved instead.

### CoC Team and Chair Selection

For initial formation and ongoing membership in the CoC team, potential Primary Members will self nominate during a period designated by the OpenJS Foundation and CPC leadership. In order for self nominations to be considerd eligible, there must be no significant objections from the leadership body or bodies subject to CoC moderation. If the number of self nominations exceed the number of CoC seats, the CPC will hold an election in consideration of all eligible candidates.


### Eligibility

Primary Members of the CoC Team, and any alternates or secondary members must: 

* Be committed to enforcing the Foundation's CoC
* Agree with all of it or clearly identify any areas that are concerning or would preculde participation
* Be willing to treat every alleged offender in the same way regardless of the impact of their contributions to open source
* Be willing to abide by the commitments described in the Commitment section of the CoC itself and in the Foundation CoC Requirements doc

### Term

Members of the CoC Team, including the CoC Chair, serve a 1-year term and will be re-confirmed on a yearly basis.
