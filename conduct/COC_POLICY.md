# Code of Conduct Policy

The OpenJS Foundation (OpenJSF) delegates to the Cross Project Council (CPC), via its [charter][], the responsability of chosing, maintaining, and enforcing a Code of Conduct (CoC) for all of its projects, collab spaces, and for any related activities.

This document defines:

- OpenJSF's Code of Conduct
- OpenJSF's Commitments to reportees and victims of CoC violations


- How to report a violation
- How to escalate a report to the CoC Team
- How to appeal decision

- Enforcement
- The role of the CoC Team.
- How the members of the CoC Team are chosen by the CPC.
- The CoC Team's conflict of interest policy.
- Managing a violation report.
- How to appeal decision
- The process to manage appeals.
- The process to manage escalations.
- Requirements for projects who opt-in to manage enforcement of the CoC themselves.

## Code of Conduct

The OpenJSF's code of conduct is located at [code-of-conduct.openjsf.org][CoC]. It is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

A common code of conduct allows a common escalation and appeal process and allows better support of projects in their efforts to apply the code of conduct.

All OpenJSF projects, collab spaces, and any activites related to the OpenJSF are operating under this code of conduct unless otherwise stated. (For example, events organized in partnership with other organizations might be operating under a different code of conduct.)

Projects joining the foundation who already have a code of conduct will need to adopt the OpenJSF's CoC within three (3) months. Projects who don't already have a code of conduct operate under the OpenJSF's CoC as soon as they enter incubation.

## Reporting incidents

Reporting incidents should be as simple and flexible as possible. All informationation necessary to report an incident should be available directly alongside the code of conduct itself.

## Commitment

The OpenJSF makes the following commitments to reportees and victims of CoC incidents:

1. All incident reports will be reviewed, investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
2. The identity of the victim(s) and reporter(s) of a code of conduct violation will be kept confidential.

## Conflict of Interest

Any member of Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team) who is involved in an incident must immediately inform the CoC Team of the conflict of interest and recuse themselves from the incident management process.

## Enforcement

### Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team)

The Cross Project Council (CPC) delegates enforcement of the code of conduct to the Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team).

The structure of the CoC Team and the process by which its members are chosen are described in the [CoC Team processes][].

The current composition of the CoC Team is available in the [code of conduct][CoC] itself along with means to contact by email the whole CoC Team and each of it members individually.

The CoC Team is responsible for maintaining and applying the [incident mangement processes][].

### Delegation to projects

Projects may opt-in to enforce the code of conduct themselves provided they meet the requirements [described below][requirements for delegation].

However, reportees, victims, and offenders may escalate an issue to the CoC Team at any point in the process to avoid a conflict of interest and appeal the decision up to thirty (30) days after a response to the complaint was provided if they believe that the process was not followed properly.

Each project is free to implement enforcement of the Code of Conduct using processes appropriate for the size and scope of the project including any day-to-day moderation of the project spaces. As part
of these processes, however, the project must agree to:
  * maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident
  * to participate in and document the path for escalation as outlined in the section on Escalation.
## Moderation

Each project is free to implement moderation processes appropriate for the size and scope of the project provided these processes abide by the code of conduct and by this policy.

## Escalation

It is expected that most reports will be handled successfully by the processes put
in place by a project (for reports made to a project) or the CPC (in the
case of reports relating to spaces within the scope of the foundation versus a project).
In exceptional cases where a reporter wishes to challenge the response from the CPC or
project, or does not feel comfortable reporting through the standard processes, an escalation
report can be made to report@openjsf.org.

All escalations will be reviewed and investigated by the Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP)
and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
The Code of Conduct panel is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard
to the reporter of an escalation.

## Appeals

Victim(s) and offender(s) of an incident have thirty (30) days to appeal the decision made in response to an incident report if they believe the process was not properly followed.

Appeals are not suspensive.

## Requirements for projects who opt-in to manage enforcement of the CoC themselves.

For spaces managed by member projects, the project must provide an email to which complaints can be forwarded and document that complaints will be investigated and will result in a response that is deemed appropriate for the circumstances.
Each project is free to implement enforcement of the Code of Conduct using processes appropriate for the size and scope of the project including any day-to-day moderation of the project spaces.
As part of these processes, however, the project must agree to:
  * maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident
  * to participate in and document the path for escalation as outlined in the section on Escalation.
