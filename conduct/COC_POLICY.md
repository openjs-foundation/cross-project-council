# Foundation Code of Conduct Requirements

The OpenJS Foundation (OpenJSF) delegates to the Cross Project Council (CPC), via its [charter][], the responsability of chosing, maintaining, and enforcing a Code of Conduct (CoC) for all of its projects, collab spaces, and for any related activities.

This document defines:

- OpenJSF's Code of Conduct
- OpenJSF's Commitments to reportees and victims of CoC violations


- How to report a violation
- How to escalate a report to the CoC Team
- How to appeal decision

- Enforcement
- The role of the CoC Team.
- How the members of the CoC Team are chosen by the CPC.
- The CoC Team's conflict of interest policy.
- Managing a violation report.
- How to appeal decision
- The process to manage appeals.
- The process to manage escalations.
- Requirements for projects who opt-in to manage enforcement of the CoC themselves.

## Code of Conduct

The OpenJSF's code of conduct is located at [code-of-conduct.openjsf.org][CoC]. It is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

All OpenJSF projects, collab spaces, and any activites related to the OpenJSF are operating under this code of conduct unless otherwise satated. (For example, events organized in partnership with other organizations might be operating under a different code of conduct.)

Projects joining the foundation who already have a code of conduct will need to adopt the OpenJSF's CoC within three (3) months. Projects who don't already have a code of conduct operate under the OpenJSF's CoC as soon as they enter incubation.

## Commitment

The OpenJSF makes the following commitments to reportees and victims of CoC violations:

1. All complaints will be reviewed, investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
2. The identity of the victim(s) and reporter(s) of a code of conduct violation will be kept confidential.

## Reporting a violation



## Enforcement

The CPC delegates enforcement of the CoC to the CoC Team.

Projects may opt-in to enforce the CoC themselves provided they meet the requirements [described below][delegation to projects]. However, reportees, victims, and offenders may escalate an issue to the CoC Team at any point in the process to avoid a conflict of interest and appeal the decision up to thirty (30) days after a response to the complaint was provided if they believe that the process was not followed properly.

For spaces managed by the Foundation, complaints can be forwarded to report@openjsf.org and will be investigated by the Cross Project Council (CPC) or its delegates.

A common Code of Conduct will allow a common
escalation process and will allow the Foundation to better support projects in their efforts to apply
the Code of Conduct.



For spaces managed by member projects, the project must provide an email to which complaints
can be forwarded and document that complaints will be investigated and will result in a
response that is deemed appropriate for the circumstances. Each project is free to
implement enforcement of the Code of Conduct using processes appropriate for the size
and scope of the project including any day-to-day moderation of the project spaces. As part
of these processes, however, the project must agree to:
  * maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident
  * to participate in and document the path for escalation as outlined in the section on Escalation.

## Escalation

It is expected that most reports will be handled successfully by the processes put
in place by a project (for reports made to a project) or the CPC (in the
case of reports relating to spaces within the scope of the foundation versus a project).
In exceptional cases where a reporter wishes to challenge the response from the CPC or
project, or does not feel comfortable reporting through the standard processes, an escalation
report can be made to report@openjsf.org.

All escalations will be reviewed and investigated by the Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP)
and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
The Code of Conduct panel is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard
to the reporter of an escalation.

### Code of Conduct panel

The Code of Conduct panel is a cross-foundation team who have been trained in moderation
and code of conduct issues. The makeup of this team is as follows:

* OpenJS Foundation Executive Director - Robin Ginn (@rginn)
* OpenJS Foundation Marketing Lead - Kylie Wagar-Dirks (@kyliewd)
* 3 community members from the Cross Project Council
  - TBD
  - TBD
  - TBD

Members of the CoCP team will be added for a 1-year term and will be re-confirmed on
a yearly basis.

## Resources

The CPC will establish a sub-team which will build a set of resources/processes that
can be reused by projects when implementing their CoC processes and enforcement.

## Requirements for projects who opt-in to manage enforcement of the CoC themselves.

For spaces managed by member projects, the project must provide an email to which complaints can be forwarded and document that complaints will be investigated and will result in a response that is deemed appropriate for the circumstances.
Each project is free to implement enforcement of the Code of Conduct using processes appropriate for the size and scope of the project including any day-to-day moderation of the project spaces.
As part of these processes, however, the project must agree to:
  * maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident
  * to participate in and document the path for escalation as outlined in the section on Escalation.
