This document defines the OpenJS Foundation's code of conduct policy.

If you want to report an incident, go to [code-of-conduct.openjsf.org][CoC].

# Code of Conduct Policy

The OpenJS Foundation (OpenJSF) delegates to the Cross Project Council (CPC), via its [charter][], the responsability of chosing, maintaining, and enforcing a Code of Conduct (CoC) for all of its projects, collab spaces, and for any related activities.

## Code of Conduct

The OpenJSF's code of conduct is located at [code-of-conduct.openjsf.org][CoC]. It is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

A common code of conduct allows a common escalation and appeal process and allows better support of projects in their efforts to apply the code of conduct.

All OpenJSF projects, collab spaces, and any activites related to the OpenJSF are operating under this code of conduct unless otherwise stated. (For example, events organized in partnership with other organizations might be operating under a different code of conduct.)

Projects joining the foundation who already have a code of conduct will need to adopt the OpenJSF's CoC within three (3) months. Projects who don't already have a code of conduct operate under the OpenJSF's CoC as soon as they enter incubation.

## Reporting incidents

Reporting incidents should be as simple and flexible as possible.

All information necessary to report an incident must be publicly documented directly alongside the code of conduct itself. This information must contain at least the following:

1. A general email address at which incidents can be reported.
2. The name and email address of each recipient of the general email address.

Reporters may chose to report an incident by using the general email address provided or by contacting any of its recipient individually, either by using their provided email, reaching out in person, or by any other reasonable mean.

An acknowledgement of receipt should be promptly issued to incident reporters.

The name and contact details of the people responsible for managing the incident report should be provided to reporters as soon as possible (to uncover conflicts of interest upfront and allow for escalation).

## Commitment

The OpenJSF makes the following commitments to reporters and victims of CoC incidents:

1. All incident reports will be reviewed, investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
2. The identity of the victim(s) and reporter(s) of a code of conduct violation will be kept confidential.

## Conflict of Interest

Any person involved with the management of an incident report must immediatly notify the CoC Team in written and recuse themselves from the process if they have been involved in the incident itself or have any other conflict of interest with any of the involved parties (e.g. same employer).

## Enforcement

### Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team)

The Cross Project Council (CPC) delegates enforcement of the code of conduct to the Code of Conduct Team (CoC Team).

The structure of the CoC Team and the process by which its members are chosen are described in the [CoC Team processes][].

The current composition of the CoC Team is available in the [code of conduct][CoC] itself along with means to contact by email the whole CoC Team and each of it members individually.

The CoC Team is responsible for maintaining and applying the [incident mangement processes][].

### Delegation to projects

Projects may opt-in to enforce the code of conduct themselves provided they meet the following requirement:

1. Agree to abide by this policy.
2. Provide a general email address that incidents can be reported to and document it alongside the code of conduct.
3. Define and publicly document a process by which the project selects people responsible for managing incident reports. For Impact and At Large projects, at least two people must be selected.
4. List the people responsible for managing incident reports alongside the code of conduct as outlined in the [Reporting incidents section](#reporting-incidents).
5. Publicly document their decision-making process for responding to incident reports.
6. Participate in good faith in the escalation and appeal processes.

Reporters, victims, and offenders may [escalate](#escalation) an issue to the CoC Team at any point in the process in case of a conflict of interest. They may [appeal](#appeals) the decision to the CoC Team up to thirty (30) days after a response was provided if they believe that the process was not followed properly.

## Moderation

Each project is free to implement moderation processes appropriate for the size and scope of the project provided these processes abide by the code of conduct and by this policy.

## Escalation

It is expected that most reports will be handled successfully by the processes put
in place by a project (for reports made to a project) or the CPC (in the
case of reports relating to spaces within the scope of the foundation versus a project).
In exceptional cases where a reporter wishes to challenge the response from the CPC or
project, or does not feel comfortable reporting through the standard processes, an escalation
report can be made to report@openjsf.org.

All escalations will be reviewed and investigated by the Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP)
and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
The Code of Conduct panel is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard
to the reporter of an escalation.

## Appeals

Victim(s) and offender(s) of an incident have thirty (30) days to appeal the decision made in response to an incident report if they believe the process was not properly followed.

Appeals are not suspensive.
