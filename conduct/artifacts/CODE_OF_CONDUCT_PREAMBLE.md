# Code of Conduct

The OpenJS Foundation and its member projects use a modified version of the Contributor Covenant as their code of conduct, and the translations from the original script will not reflect all modifications. The full text is included below in English, and [the original translations](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/translations) are available on the Contributor Covenant website.

## Commitment

All recipients of reports commit to:

- maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter and victim of an incident
- participate in the path for escalation as outlined in the section on Escalation when required

## Report an issue in a space managed by the foundation

For reporting issues in spaces managed by the OpenJS Foundation, for example, repositories within the OpenJS organization or an live event such as a conferences, email <report@lists.openjsf.org>. The Cross Project Council (CPC) is responsible for managing these reports.

## Escalate an issue

The OpenJS Foundation maintains a [Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP)](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/conduct/FOUNDATION_CODE_OF_CONDUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md#code-of-conduct-panel). This is a foundation-wide team established to manage escalation when a reporter believes that a report to a member project or the CPC has not been properly handled.

In order to escalate to the CoCP, email <coc-escalation@lists.openjsf.org>.
