### Section 2.10 *Termination or Suspension of* *Member by JS Foundation*

Any Member may be suspended from Membership or have its Membership
terminated by the Board for failure to satisfy its Membership
Obligations or for engaging in any conduct, either within or without the
JS Foundation, that is contrary to the Purposes of the JS Foundation.
Financial Obligations already paid shall not be refundable upon any such
termination or suspension, and all Financial Obligations of such Member
which may be accrued and unpaid as of the date of such termination shall
remain due and payable. Terminations or suspensions of Membership for
failure to satisfy Financial Obligations within 60 days of invoice may
be imposed with notice and without right of formal appeal under such
procedures as the Board may from time to time approve. Except as
provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.10, no termination or
suspension of Membership for any other purpose shall be effective
unless:

\(a) The Member is given notice of the proposed termination or suspension
of Membership and of the reasons therefor;

\(b) Such notice is delivered personally or by certified mail, return
receipt requested, or by a national or international overnight courier
service, sent to the last address of the Member shown on the JS
Foundation’s records;

\(c) Such notice is given at least thirty days prior to the effective
date of the proposed termination or suspension of Membership;

\(d) Such notice sets forth a procedure determined by the Board (or other
body authorized by the Board) to decide whether or not the proposed
termination or suspension shall take place, whereby the Member is given
the opportunity to be heard by such body, either orally (and represented
by counsel if the Member so desires, at its sole cost and expense) or in
writing, not less than five days before the effective date of the
proposed termination or suspension; and

\(e) Such termination or suspension of Membership is approved by Super
Majority Vote of the Board.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Board believes in
good faith that a Member is engaging in willful misconduct or otherwise
acting to the material detriment of the best interests of the JS
Foundation and its Members, the Board, acting by Super Majority Vote,
may suspend such Member’s Membership immediately, provided that such
Member is otherwise afforded the protections provided for in subsections
(a), (b) and (d) of this Section 2.10.

### Section 2.11 *Resignation by Member*

A Member may resign as a Member at any time. Any Financial Obligations
already paid by such Member shall not be refundable upon any
resignation, including any termination of Membership pursuant to Section
2.10 above, and all such Financial Obligations of such Member which may
be accrued and unpaid as of such date shall remain due and payable. If a
Platinum Member gives written notice of non-renewal or resigns as a
Member, or is terminated, the JS Foundation shall promptly give notice
of such event to all Members.

### Section 2.12 *Levy of Dues, Assessments or Fees*

The JS Foundation may levy dues, assessments or fees upon its Members in
such amounts as may be approved from time to time by the Board, but
shall provide at least thirty (30) days’ notice of such levy. For the
avoidance of doubt, no such levy shall be effective until at least
thirty (30) days have passed since the provision of notice. A Member
upon learning of any increase in dues, or of any levy of any assessments
or fees, may avoid liability therefor by resigning from Membership prior
to the date such dues, assessments or fees are due and payable, except
where the Member is, by contract with the JS Foundation or otherwise,
independently and explicitly liable for such dues, assessments or fees.
No provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the JS
Foundation authorizing such dues, assessments or fees shall, of itself,
create such liability. In no event shall the failure of a Member to pay
any dues or assessments give rise to any claim in favor of the JS
Foundation for indirect or consequential damages.

### Section 2.13 *Use of Names*

Unless otherwise provided herein, neither the JS Foundation nor any
Member shall use the name, logo, trademark, service mark or other
distinctive mark of another Member in any form of publicity without the
written permission of the other Member, provided that the JS Foundation
and any Member may each disclose and publicize such Member’s Membership
in the JS Foundation.

### Section 2.14 *Rights in Intellectual Property*

The Board shall give all Members at least thirty (30) days’ notice prior
to the adoption of, or any material change to, any intellectual property
rights policy or any other material policy or procedure governing
intellectual property, such that any Member may resign its membership
prior to the effective date thereof in accordance with Section 2.11
above. For the avoidance of doubt, no such adoption or material change
shall be effective until at least thirty (30) days have passed since the
provision of notice. A material change shall be deemed to include,
without limitation, the imposition of a patent license obligation on
Members, and a change in the license applicable to Members’
contributions.

## ARTICLE III - ACTIONS OF MEMBERS

### Section 3.1 *Action Without Meeting*

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Members, or any
class of Members under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, or at
any meeting of a Member Committee, Working Group thereof or other group
of Members or subset of Members, may be taken without prior notice and
without an in-person vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the
action to be taken, shall be signed by Members (or all members of a
class of Members, as the case may be), making up not less than that
percentage of all Members as would be necessary to authorize or take
such action at a meeting at which all Members (or class of Members, as
the case may be) entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, in
accordance with Section 2.15(c) of the General Corporation Law of
Delaware. Pursuant to such written consent, the Voting Members shall
elect a Board in accordance with Section 4.3 on an annual basis. Prompt
notice of the taking of any corporate action without a meeting by less
than unanimous written consent shall be given to those otherwise
entitled to vote thereon who have not consented in writing. An
electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and
transmitted by a Member or by a person or persons authorized to act for
a Member or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated
for the purposes of this Section, provided that any such electronic
transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the
JS Foundation can determine (a) that the electronic transmission was
transmitted by the Member or by a person or persons authorized to act
for the Member and (b) the date on which such Member or authorized
person or persons transmitted such electronic transmission. The date on
which such electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be
the date on which such consent was signed. Consents given by electronic
transmission (i) may be delivered by electronic transmission to the
principal place of business of the JS Foundation or to an Officer or
agent of the JS Foundation having custody of the book in which actions
of Members without a meeting are recorded, need not be reproduced in
paper form, and may be maintained in electronic form as long as they are
capable of being readily reproduced in paper form, and (ii) may be
otherwise delivered to the principal place of business of the JS
Foundation or to an Officer or agent of the JS Foundation having custody
of the book in which actions of Members without a meeting are recorded
if, to the extent and in the manner provided by resolution of the Board.

Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in
writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for
any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used,
provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a
complete reproduction of the entire original writing.

### Section 3.2 *Nomination and Election Procedures*

reasonable nomination and election procedures given the nature, size,
and operations of the JS Foundation, including a reasonable means for

Board, which shall be, and shall possess all of the powers of, the

exercise all powers of the JS Foundation and do all such lawful acts and
things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or
by these By-laws directed or required to be exercised or done by the
Members.

### Section 4.2 *Number of Directors*

\(a) Subject to Section 4.2(b) and Section 4.4 below, the total number of
Directors shall be the number of Platinum Members, plus the number of
Gold Members divided by three (3) (rounded down to the nearest whole
number but at least one (1) at any time there is at least one (1) Gold
Member), plus the number of Silver Members divided by ten (10) (rounded
down to the nearest whole number but at least one (1) at any time there
is at least one (1) Silver Member), plus one (1) (the "Maximum Director
Number"). The Board shall comprise the Directors described in Section

\(b) In no event shall the Maximum Director Number ever exceed two (2)
times the number of Platinum Members.

### Section 4.3 *Nomination, Election and Term of Office of Directors*

\(a) Each Platinum Member (while remaining in good standing) shall be
entitled individually to appoint one Director (each a “Platinum
Director”). Each Platinum Director shall serve until the next annual
action of Members without a meeting and until his or her successor shall
be duly appointed or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.

\(b) Each Gold Member (while remaining in good standing) shall have the
right to vote, together with the other Gold Members as a class, and to
elect a number of Directors (each, a “Gold Director”) equal to the
greater of (i) one (1) and (ii) the number of Gold Members then in good
standing divided by three (3) (rounded down to the nearest whole number)
up to a maximum of three (3); provided that the number of Gold-elected
Board seats do not exceed the number of Platinum-elected Board seats
minus one.Each Gold Director shall serve in accordance with Section
4.3(e) below and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or
until his or her earlier resignation or removal. The selection of
nominees for such position(s) shall be performed under such nominating
procedures as may be set by the Board from time to time. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that after any
annual election of Directors, the number of Platinum Members decreases,
resulting in a corresponding decrease in the Maximum Director Number,
and such decrease causes a situation where the number of Gold Directors
previously elected exceeds the number specified in this Section 4.3(b),
then in such event all Gold Directors previously elected may serve until
the next annual election of Directors, at which time the required
decrease in the number of Gold Directors shall take effect.

\(c) Each Silver Member (while remaining in good standing) shall have the
right to vote, together with the other Silver Members as a class, and to
elect a number of Directors (each, a “Silver Director”) equal to the
greater of (i) one (1) and (ii) the number of Silver Members then in
good standing divided by ten (10) (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) up to a maximum of three (3); provided that the number of
Silver-elected Board seats do not exceed the number of Platinum-elected
Board seats minus one nor the number of Gold-elected Board seats. Each
Silver Director shall serve in accordance with Section 4.3(e) below and
until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her
earlier resignation or removal. The selection of nominees for such
position(s) shall be performed under such nominating procedures as may
be set by the Board from time to time.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event
that after any annual election of Directors, the number of Platinum
Members or the number of Gold Members decreases, resulting in a
corresponding decrease in the Maximum Director Number, and such decrease
causes a situation where the number of Silver Directors previously
elected exceeds the number specified in this Section 4.3(c), then in
such event all Silver Directors previously elected may serve until the
next annual election of Directors, at which time the required decrease
in the number of Silver Directors shall take effect.

\(d) Any Director nominated, appointed or elected by any class of
Members, or by any Member, may, but shall not automatically, be
re-nominated, re-appointed and/or re-elected for additional terms.

\(e) Each Director (other than the TAC Director) shall be an employee of
the Member which nominated or appointed him or her. Each Director (other
than the TAC Director) shall hold office until the earliest to occur of
the expiration of the term for which such Director was elected and such
Director’s successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her
earlier death, resignation, removal or termination of employment for any
reason with the nominating or appointing Member, and in the case of a
Platinum or Silver Director, until the earlier of (i) expiration or
termination of Membership of the Member that nominated or appointed such
Director, (ii) the combination, by merger, acquisition or otherwise, of
two Members that each have representatives on the Board, upon which
event one of the two representatives, as designated by the surviving
Member, shall be deemed to have resigned, or (iii) if requested by the
Board or the employer of such Director, upon the termination of the
employment of such Director by the Member represented by such Director.
In addition, during such times as the Membership of any Member that has
a representative serving as a Director is suspended pursuant to Section
2.10 above, the attendance and voting rights of such Director
representative shall also be suspended until such time, if ever, as the
suspension of such Member is lifted.

\(f) Each Platinum, Gold or Silver Director (or the Member that appointed
or is the employer of such Director) may designate in writing (which
designation may be withdrawn in writing at any time by such Director or
Member) an individual to act as a Director in his or her stead, whether
for a single meeting or as a standing alternate. Any such alternate
Director shall also be an employee of the Member that appointed or
nominated the original Director. Any such alternate Director shall be
entitled to (i) attend and vote at all meetings which the designating
Director does not attend, (ii) sign all written consents in lieu of the
designating Director, and (iii) otherwise exercise the duties and enjoy
the privileges of the designating Director in the absence or
unavailability of the designating Director; provided, however, that no
such alternate Director may propose a vote or vote upon any Committee of
the Board. In addition, in lieu of making such a substitution, any
Director who will be absent for any meeting may deliver a written proxy
to the President, authorizing the President to either vote as instructed
in such proxy, or to vote in the stead of such absent Director in such
manner as the President may believe appropriate. Any such proxy shall be
valid only with respect to the meeting and such specific matters (or
with respect to all matters, if so desired) as may be stated in such
proxy.

\(g) The Board may approve from time to time such reasonable attendance
and other requirements as it shall deem to be advisable to ensure that
seats on the Board are held by active, contributing individuals. Such
rules may provide that any Member which has appointed or nominated a
Director, as the case may be, may lose its ability to appoint and/or
nominate a representative to the Board in the event that such
requirements have not been met, and/or that a Director who fails to meet
such requirements shall automatically be deemed to have resigned from
the Board, but no such rule may be imposed retroactively.

### Section 4.4 *Enlargement or Reduction*

Subject to Section 2.8 above and Section 4.10 below, the number of
Directors, the persons eligible to become Directors and the classes of
Members eligible to appoint, elect and/or nominate Directors may be
amended at any time by a Super Majority Vote (as defined in Section
4.10(b)) of the Board.

### Section 4.5 *Resignation and Removal*

Any Director may resign at any time upon notice to the JS Foundation in
writing or by electronic transmission at the principal place of business
of the JS Foundation or to the President or Secretary. Such resignation
shall be effective upon receipt unless it is specified to be effective
at some other time or upon the happening of some other event. Any
Director who was appointed by a Member under Section 4.3(a) may be
removed by that Member at any time, and for any reason, or for no
reason. Any or all of the Directors who were elected by a class of
Members voting as a class or by the Board may be removed by a majority
vote of such class of Members or the Board, respectively. Unless
otherwise specified by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, any
Director may be removed by a majority of the other Directors then in
office for engaging in any conduct, either within or without the JS
Foundation, that is contrary to the interests of the JS Foundation or to
the advancement of the JS Foundation’s business or industry goals;
provided, however, that the Member or class of Members that appointed
and elected or nominated and elected (as the case may be) such removed
Director shall be entitled to appoint and elect or nominate and elect
(as the case may be) a replacement for such removed Director to serve
for the balance of such removed Director’s term. The TAC Director shall
automatically cease to be a Director at such time as he or she ceases
for any reason to be the Chair of the TAC.

### Section 4.6 *Vacancies*

\(a) Vacancies on the Board occurring as a result of the death,
resignation, removal or termination of employment of a Director who was
appointed and elected by a Member, or who was nominated and elected by a
class of Members, may be filled by such Member or class of Members, as
applicable. All other vacancies shall be filled by the vote of a
majority of Directors then in office, whether or not less than a quorum,
or by a sole remaining Director. The term of a Director so appointed or
elected shall be the unexpired portion of the term of the Director, if
any, whom the Director so appointed or elected is replacing.

\(b) In the event of a vacancy in the Board, the remaining Directors,
except as otherwise provided by law or these By-laws, may exercise the
powers of the full Board until the vacancy is filled.

or on the written request of two or more Directors, or by one Director
in the event that there is only one Director in office. Two business

sent to his or her business or home address, or three business days’
notice by written notice deposited in the mail, shall be given to each
Director by the Secretary or by the Officer or one of the Directors
calling the meeting. A notice or waiver of notice or any waiver by
electronic transmission of a meeting of the Board need not specify the
purposes of the meeting.

Section 4.10 Quorum, Action at Meeting, Adjournments

\(a) At all meetings of the Board a majority of Directors then in office,
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of

specifically provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
By-laws.

\(b) In order to pass a “Super Majority Vote”, a resolution must be taken
at a meeting of the Board at which a quorum is present and in support of

reimbursement of expenses for members of Board Committees in connection
with their service on such Board Committees.

## ARTICLE VII - NOTICES

### Section 7.1 *Delivery*

\(a) Whenever, under the provisions of law, or of the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-laws, written notice is required to be given
to any Director or Member, such notice may be given by mail, addressed
to such Director or Member, at his, her or its address as it appears on
the records of the JS Foundation, with postage thereon prepaid. Unless
written notice by mail is required by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or another provision of these By-laws, and subject to the
provisions below relating to notice by electronic transmission to
Members, written notice may also be given by electronic mail, telecopy,
commercial delivery service, or similar means, addressed to such
Director or Member at his, her or its address as it appears on the
records of the JS Foundation. Without limiting the manner by which
notice otherwise may be given effectively to Members, any notice to
Members given by the JS Foundation under any provision of law, the
Certificate of Incorporation, or the By-laws, unless written notice by
mail is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or another
provision of these By-laws, shall be effective if given by a form of
electronic transmission consented to by the Member to whom the notice is
given.

\(b) Notice given pursuant to this Section shall be deemed given: (i) if
by facsimile telecommunication (A) to a Member, when directed to a
number at which the Member has consented to receive notice and (B) to a
Director, when directed to the number for such Director as it appears on
the records of the JS Foundation; (ii) if by electronic mail to (A) a
Member, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the Member
has consented to receive notice and (B) to a Director, when directed to
the electronic mail address for such Director as it appears on the
records of the JS Foundation; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic
network together with separate notice to the Member or Director of such
specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving
of such separate notice; (iv) if by any other form of electronic
transmission, when directed to the Member or Director; (v) if by in-hand
delivery or oral notice, at the time it is actually given; (vi) if by
mail, at the time when the same shall be deposited in the United States
mail; and (vii) if by commercial delivery carrier or similar means, at
the time when the same shall be deposited with the carrier, in each case
the transmission charge to be paid by the JS Foundation or the person
sending such notice and not by the addressee. An affidavit of the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or other
agent of the JS Foundation that the notice has been given by a form of
electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie
evidence of the facts stated therein.

\(c) For purposes of these By-laws, “electronic transmission” means any
form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission
of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and
reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in
paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.

\(d) Without limiting the foregoing, the JS Foundation adopts electronic
mail as its principal source of communication with its Members. Each
Member acknowledges and agrees that the

JS Foundation shall not be under any obligation (except as required by
law or these By-laws) to send any notice to any Member by any means
other than electronic mail, and it is therefore the responsibility of
each Member to avail itself of and make such arrangements as may be
necessary to receive notice in such fashion.

### Section 7.2 *Waiver of Notice*

Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of law
or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these By-laws, a waiver
thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said
notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, or a waiver by
electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, shall be
deemed equivalent thereto.

## ARTICLE VIII - INDEMNIFICATION

### Section 8.1 *Actions other than by or in the Right of the JS
Foundation *

Subject to confirmation of the appropriateness of such action by the
Board as provided in Section 8.4 below, the JS Foundation shall
indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(other than an action by or in the right of the JS Foundation) by reason
of the fact that he or she is or was a Director, Officer, employee or
agent of the JS Foundation, or is or was serving at the request of the
JS Foundation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or
her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he or she
acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the JS Foundation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceedings, had no reasonable cause
to believe this conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action,
suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a
plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create
a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner
which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the JS Foundation, and, with respect to any criminal action
or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct
was unlawful.

### Section 8.2 *Actions by or in the Right of the JS Foundation*

Subject to confirmation of the appropriateness of such action by the
Board as provided in Section 8.4 below, the JS Foundation shall
indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in
the right of the JS Foundation to procure a judgment in its favor by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a Director, Officer,
employee or agent of the JS Foundation, or is or was serving at the
request of the JS Foundation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and
in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the JS Foundation; provided, however, that no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter
as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable unless,
and only to the extent that, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability
but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly
and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem
proper. 18

### Section 8.3 *Success on the Merits*

To the extent that any person described in Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this
Article VIII has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense

indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.

### Section 8.4 *Specific Authorization*

Any indemnification under Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Article VIII

the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in said Sections. Such determination shall be made (a)
by a majority vote of a such Directors who were not parties to such
action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum or (b) by the
Members of the JS Foundation.

### Section 8.5 *Advance Payment*

Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or
proceeding shall be paid by the JS Foundation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of any person described in said Section to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is
not entitled to indemnification by the JS Foundation as authorized in
this Article VIII.

### Section 8.6 *Non-Exclusivity*

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, the other Sections of this Article VIII shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those provided indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-law, agreement,
vote of disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his
or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office.

### Section 8.7 *Jurisdiction of Delaware Court of Chancery*

The Delaware Court of Chancery is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to
hear and determine all actions for advancement of expenses or
indemnification. The Delaware Court of Chancery may summarily determine

fees).

enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and

her status as such, whether or not the JS Foundation would have the
power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the
provisions of this Article VIII.

### Section 8.9 *Continuation of Indemnification and Advancement of
Expenses *

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article VIII shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the JS Foundation
and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

### Section 8.10 *Severability*

If any word, clause or provision of this Article VIII or any award made
hereunder shall for any reason be determined to be invalid, the
provisions hereof shall not otherwise be affected thereby but shall
remain in full force and effect.

### Section 8.11 *Intent of Article*

The intent of this Article VIII is to provide for indemnification and
advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145
of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. To the extent that such
Section or any successor section may be amended or supplemented from
time to time, this Article VIII shall be amended automatically and
construed so as to permit indemnification and advancement of expenses to
the fullest extent from time to time permitted by law.

## ARTICLE XIII - ANTITRUST COMPLIANCE

### Section 13.1 *General*

The JS Foundation will conduct all of its activities in conformance with
all international, U.S. federal and state antitrust laws and competition
laws, including but not limited to the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the
Robinson-Patman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the EU
Competition Regulations. The Board and the President shall consult legal
counsel and seek legal review whenever necessary to ensure that the
activities of the JS Foundation are conducted in conformance with such
laws.

Each of the Members of the JS Foundation is committed to fostering
competition in the development of new products and services, and the
activities of the JS Foundation are intended to promote such
competition. Each Member acknowledges that it may compete with other
Members in various lines of business and that it is therefore imperative
that they and their representatives act in a manner that does not
violate any applicable state, federal or international antitrust laws or
regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Members
that are competitors shall not discuss issues relating to product costs,
product pricing, methods or channels of product distribution, any
division of markets, or allocation of customers, or any other topic that
would be prohibited by applicable antitrust laws.

Each Member shall assume responsibility to provide appropriate legal
counsel to its representatives acting under these Bylaws regarding the
importance of limiting the scope of their discussions to the topics that
relate to the Purposes of the JS Foundation, whether or not such
discussions take place during formal meetings, informal gatherings, or
otherwise.

### Section 13.2 *Availability of Intellectual Property*

It is the good faith objective of the Foundation (a) to make all open
source software available promptly as it is developed and owned by the
Foundation on the same terms and conditions to all Members and at the
same point in time to all Members, and (b) to make all such open source
software available to all non-Members under the same open source
license(s).

### Section 13.3 *No Obligation to Endorse*

No Member shall, by reason of its Membership or participation in the JS
Foundation or otherwise, be obligated to license from the JS Foundation,
use or endorse any intellectual property developed or endorsed by the JS
Foundation, or to conform any of its products to any code base,
specification or platform developed or adopted by an Project, nor shall
any such Member be precluded from independently licensing, using or
endorsing similar intellectual property, platform, software,
specifications or documentation developed by it or by others. No
provision of these By-Laws or the membership agreement shall be
interpreted to prevent any Member from using any technology or platform
other than technology of the Projects, or from engaging in other
activities or business ventures, independently or with others, whether
or not competitive with the activities contemplated herein or those of
any Member

## ARTICLE XIV - AMENDMENTS

Except as otherwise required under these Bylaws, or where such power is
expressly limited by law or the Certificate of Incorporation as to any
specific action, these By-laws may be altered, amended or repealed, and
new By-laws may be adopted, in each case by (i) a Super Majority Vote of
the Board of Directors or (ii) the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the
Voting Members then in good standing, at any annual meeting of the
Voting Members or regular meeting of the Board of Directors or at any
special meeting of the Voting Members or of the Board of Directors,
provided, however, that in the case of a regular or special meeting of
Voting Members, notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption
of new By-laws shall be contained in the notice of such meeting.
