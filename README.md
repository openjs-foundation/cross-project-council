# Cross Project Council

The OpenJS Foundation Cross Project Council (CPC) is the technical governing body of the OpenJS Foundation. It is described in the [CPC Charter](./CPC-CHARTER.md)

## CPC Scope

The CPC's primary role is to foster an environment of collaboration. That environment extends within and between OpenJS Foundation Projects, OpenJS Collaboration spaces, and the larger community.

The CPC exercises autonomy in managing its responsibilities and seeks agreement from the OpenJS Foundation Board on any change to the scope of those responsibilities.
